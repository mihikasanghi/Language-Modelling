was it not agreed asked the count that not only my person but also that of my friends should be respected by you and how have i broken that treaty your excellency you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf	301.5865
dartagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts	910.2118
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation i did not sleep well you raoul not sleep well	795.1898
aramis at this movement drew his sword	700.7269
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen	388.8247
were i in her majestys place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen	816.5317
<unk> it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame <unk> is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly	594.7341
they then determined to depart	1399.7863
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux bonacieux became as pale as death and <unk> a ghastly smile	1399.9065
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself	532.8376
we shall both get into trouble	2391.9673
who can possibly have told you i had had that dream	462.1273
i fancy i remember it	1097.2582
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its <unk> cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the <unk> what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	1462.1316
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the <unk> force of which he was not inclined to dispute	749.5460
after all i am not an unreasonable man	604.1272
have you <unk> it for your diamond no	1729.3273
alone asked athos	550.5432
nobody knew a word of this enigma	936.8249
chapter xxxiii	218.0136
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind franz smiled an instant after the count entered	575.6945
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again	1092.3969
his person had undergone a change <unk> to the change in his dress his figure had grown <unk> and as it were <unk>	2206.7139
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	653.3039
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but the count of monte cristo himself	548.3683
the party was to take place at st germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah	651.8662
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder	1209.3967
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach	700.2807
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner <unk> on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo	810.3563
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of <unk>	1273.7854
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish	927.0994
ah indeed said davrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to <unk> did not let him finish	1396.0448
if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not <unk> started as if he had been electrified	913.1597
what <unk> thou here good for nothing she said and why art thou not at notre dame i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazins <unk> know mother monsieur bazin the <unk> came to speak to monsieur broussel and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	1398.9962
the devil take this gout athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	828.7809
did you ever suffer from a strain athos never	1342.1298
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him	252.8470
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	850.3856
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop	326.3864
i do replied athos with a deep sigh	659.7371
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them then <unk> madame m danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars	1905.2065
excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace accustomed as franz was to the italian <unk> his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him	852.7354
yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy <unk> not too much so replied dartagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me <unk> i can tell you	384.2478
bonacieux	98.5834
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of mercds led the girl to her home while some friends of dants conducted his father nearly lifeless to the alles de meilhan	483.9073
then i will go to the governor of <unk> he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier i will tell him my gloomy story	691.6454
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances	1015.5434
but continued dartagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	429.8011
the king opened it and found in it two diamond studs	584.5225
perfectly safe and sound my good host and i wish to know what has become of our young man he is better said the host he fainted quite away indeed said the gentleman	440.1526
debray had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong madame	444.7061
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible	1096.0602
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	870.5370
you were told to guard <unk> fire at her if she attempted to fly	1781.0479
all this is very extraordinary said chteau renaud still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed	1022.5538
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears	608.5891
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers go cornlie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer cornlie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray	280.0770
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices hunting horns bass <unk> <unk> whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> music had been succeeded by painting foils <unk> gloves <unk> and single <unk> following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf <unk> with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a <unk> education <unk> fencing <unk> and single stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles <unk>	456.5281
alas	47.6376
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper	752.8501
and who brought you up he asked again	405.1248
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the me <unk> of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had <unk> monsieur de <unk> like a <unk> as he is a <unk> indeed said porthos but is the matter certain i had it from aramis replied the musketeer	1049.0005
dartagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them	585.6166
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	757.7066
zounds lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed felton blushed	1556.4257
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions	648.9014
now for the wager	565.2216
this was their mutual declaration of love	1510.3475
the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body	975.5145
at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal asked m de trville	364.2954
false he muttered	826.3671
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe	544.2091
dartagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	1397.9733
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass	390.7376
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	1064.4250
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinals decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only the deputies bowed and left the room	514.6833
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell	687.6749
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object	1720.1417
but what have you done asked franz	456.0219
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that dartagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind	760.0891
take your glass then and let us drink	722.4321
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	623.0594
every one withdrew	1416.0376
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her good murmured milady the austere puritan lies as to the soldier he only smiled	1030.0245
the king <unk> shall assemble our friends <unk> will head the <unk> england we shall re enter <unk> him securely on his throne and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect	1015.0470
they are fed on <unk> only your <unk> and how do you like my wine asked porthos it is pleasant isnt it capital it is nothing however but a wine of the country really yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty <unk> quite a vineyard hey porthos sighed for the fifth <unk> had counted his sighs	1999.5596
my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again	2426.1934
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when dartagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand	515.0295
let them come on	467.7319
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary	1059.5823
he entered by the faubourg st jacques under verdant arches	987.6001
ah said aramis but you forget the officer dartagnan grew pale with rage	739.3959
on him on him always on him	267.7299
you must have had enough for today	637.0048
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said	757.9006
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle thats very simple replied athos	511.4969
what	44.4923
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him	711.4028
m	62.8793
it remains here said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly	817.2203
the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them	1299.3967
how	52.8832
a new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead	843.1786
but grimauds <unk> was more <unk> than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses	1508.1211
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse	890.6382
what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom	756.0493
no for your skill with the sword is so well known <unk> has betrayed me the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered and you failed they positively refused morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol never well we have time look monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercds entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club	1366.9235
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words	670.4326
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection and how many hours of reflection do you ask twelve hours sir is it too long it is now noon at midnight i will be at your house if i should not be in wait for me good	857.1039
he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux	594.4211
he repaired therefore immediately to his htel and caused himself to be announced	1790.4946
during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators	730.4274
<unk> <unk> said athos	583.3268
shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future	290.1712
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude	1111.6895
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take	402.3296
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much information	859.1646
ah you speak spanish enough i think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this occasion meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place	1336.0759
taste this cutlet my dear dartagnan tis off one of my sheep you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it said dartagnan	1179.4861
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	650.3600
yes he said	94.1938
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ah	1461.6039
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started	1069.4347
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity	1488.0540
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not <unk> in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission	1409.5948
planchet said he	94.3514
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as <unk> the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural <unk> been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a <unk> of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a <unk> who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin	1153.7257
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men	261.8982
it was indeed planchet and grimaud	583.3694
i suppose that is not all to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we cannot wake up mazarin a little a bad plan youll be shut up again in the bastile oh as to that i shall take care i assure you	436.0273
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him	966.1648
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening	1236.4020
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out	914.4329
dartagnan himself was moved by them	530.4585
then i must wait asked the young man	340.0486
if you do escape remember that the poor abb whom all the world called mad was not so	494.2371
however there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my lord indeed	494.7830
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	794.1011
what the devil are you doing here count accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee	1242.3550
see the fatal example on the vendomois road dartagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so <unk> were beaten to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn	1189.6770
the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played	740.8638
the other members silently dispersed	1158.2472
yes and i take your brother with me oh count said julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance	498.5162
<unk> and now said the abb read this other paper and he presented to dants a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond read as follows <unk> invited to dine by his holiness content with making me pay for my hat serves for me the fate of cardinals <unk> i declare to my nephew <unk> spada <unk> in a place he knows the caves of the small <unk> of ingots gold money know of the existence of this treasure which lions of roman crowns and which he <unk> from the small <unk> have been made <unk> in the second tire to him <unk> spada faria followed him with an excited look	551.1058
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	708.2482
and where will your worship drink there answered the traveler pointing to the table	1297.1248
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	325.9953
didnt you see that monsieur dartagnan mounted with difficulty	524.2795
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy	619.1890
oh	72.0004
if they continue to advance we must fire again	1231.8407
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition	954.1358
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell	417.7372
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent	997.9061
a mantle piece with two modern svres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an <unk> on each <unk> representing homer carrying his guide the other <unk> <unk> <unk> paper red and black <unk> was the appearance of lord wilmores drawing room	1200.9095
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it	1334.4727
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips	537.8604
a woman could go up a ladder like that aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but dartagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity	1079.5403
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so <unk> no longer breathed	1932.7028
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	1383.3846
well you have this excuse <unk> the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer <unk> much for the world	1763.8640
yes yes continued morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears	696.1397
all three then cried <unk> over hush said dartagnan	359.3046
well i will teach you how to behave yourself and i will send you back to your mass book master abb	771.3317
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers	898.7740
then mine is the boat you want sir	484.4813
my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches	1078.6013
she was a nun in the convent of the <unk> of <unk>	1947.9633
chapter lxi	700.5413
this treasure exists dants and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will	571.8716
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to <unk> so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets	585.7113
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim	283.7086
it is you your honor he said advancing toward dartagnan and i am truly pleased to meet you dartagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre	489.2115
and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there	515.7062
let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other	533.9313
my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused	531.3534
quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock precisely very good replied albert that is all i wished to know then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow	663.3837
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly london sir if you please and my master lord dartagnan	574.7317
yes sir replied franz	1068.1311
alas	96.3303
oh take ittake it said the count hayde is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room	955.6115
59 and i no	111.1572
there were only chimeras and illusions but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras	1878.7429
if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame if you cross a bridge feel every plank of it with your foot lest one should give way beneath you if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head if you stay out late be always followed by your lackey and let your lackey be <unk> by the by you can be sure of your lackey	1202.8817
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	699.3994
send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall judge only replied trville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue cannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution	529.3740
dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer	1022.7128
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said villefort	374.7321
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you but no said <unk> i tell you it is all past and it was nothing	640.8157
i have been here since the morning	423.7094
well has anybody come out no but somebody has gone in a man or a woman a man ah	601.5134
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder chapter xxvii	374.0261
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the <unk> of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and <unk> don csar <unk> canon of the church of st john <unk> and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa and the men of his band hum	814.4141
alas	21.2032
but my lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far what do you say	572.1332
noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	443.6983
but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him	345.6355
the conversation took a cheerful turn	1987.4531
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m de villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color	438.4477
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	516.0494
blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure	1278.4727
imprisonment menaces ill <unk> has suffered everything	741.5263
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	980.0684
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a <unk> was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio	1960.0742
he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed	1916.7755
when i like caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	448.6438
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world	339.6042
at the end of three months he had learned to write	434.1255
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there	265.9303
if we stay here five minutes more theres an end of us yes you are right but where shall we go asked porthos	737.9310
his <unk> <unk> his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had <unk> recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the <unk> of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure <unk> who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king	742.2727
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded	1393.6064
he rose to return the salutation	789.9946
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass it is singular said the doctor i was not aware that madame de saint mran was subject to such <unk> it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed we will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone	828.1536
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said dartagnan that matters little	617.5825
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de trville	1377.4185
these two gentlemen shall decide between us but first i will state the case to them	641.3724
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated	556.9951
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses	1387.5406
the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms	412.0216
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	1916.2383
that is of the first importance attend to it then at once unfortunately it is a thing that i cant perform at any time i choose	390.2107
sign it then caderousse signed it	631.3857
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being <unk> than urged	758.0438
chteau renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coup joined him beauchamp did the same	1261.4108
they shook their heads	1480.8325
by whom by the gentleman who was here yesterday	426.7951
what could he say	338.5353
he has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen	399.5738
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise <unk> timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard	1482.3317
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	399.7058
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	931.1702
dartagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception	426.6433
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become <unk> as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	668.7853
i tell you to hope	317.0535
how	15.0033
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and dartagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche	365.8220
now say if i conceal anything from you no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his house	512.7065
well i too could keep a servant i too could have a tilbury i too could dine where i like but why do i not	613.7251
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction	1174.2173
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme	508.8886
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles inot the same thing by any means	592.9095
oh	46.3471
suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	1232.3524
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way no nonsense caderousse i will offer myself as floor <unk> the rooms are all carpeted well then i must be contented to imagine it that is the best plan believe me try at least to give me an idea of what it is how can i nothing is easier	1701.7356
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	1722.2437
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived monsieur you insult the majesty of justice not at all said athos calmly	693.3017
now to horse that i may see you depart raoul obeyed	850.2477
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	1596.7966
i shall kneel down to pray do not strike then when shall i strike when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember then strike boldly gentlemen said the king to those around him i leave you to brave the tempest i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms	1003.2181
i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me	1510.7510
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful <unk> floated in the breeze	1042.2296
have you seen him yes sir said mordaunt	454.0643
i was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because monsieur laporte the queens cloak bearer is her godfather and <unk> her well monsieur asked dartagnan	1545.6912
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he <unk> then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said milady perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future well here for example said richelieu when in <unk> for a cause similar to that which <unk> the duke king henry iv of glorious memory was about at the same time to <unk> flanders and italy in order to attack austria on both sides	957.9720
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur	375.8412
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur	514.0319
the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old <unk> filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv	820.2560
he reminded me of it telling me if i did not pay for you he would be paid by m morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injury well why i paid him but cried dants it was a hundred and forty francs i owed caderousse yes stammered the old man	450.9723
if his heart is free and he will marry hayde the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish	641.3996
oh no he <unk> die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much	1434.7274
now you are exactly what i <unk> you <unk> man i always loved	68.8668
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon you are adorable madame but do not keep raoul with you why not because he is in love he	925.8152
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer	1199.8090
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody i agree monsieur but do not be too confident	540.9606
my vocation commands me it carries me away dartagnan smiled but made no answer	1671.4866
he seems <unk> said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee	254.8789
then who <unk> his pistol his servant a nubian a negro it is he then do you know this gentleman yes and i am come to look for him he is a friend of mine oh that is quite another thing then	984.5735
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle	1564.8721
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	648.2621
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses	627.8473
amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the <unk> of porthos	863.9090
after a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to <unk> at least for some time the follies of <unk>	1170.8760
spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him	427.2622
oh father do not look in that way at me	326.4531
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be	951.7053
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a <unk> courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dants	1472.3026
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	651.0421
patrick discreetly kept in the background	1131.8520
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession to whom tell m cavalcanti something of the state of your finances ma foi monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord do you hear what he says major certainly i do but do you understand i do your son says he requires money well what would you have me do said the major	736.5249
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth	1789.2871
we four will go and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number you terrify me athos cried dartagnan	538.3870
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man and not more than justice either you ass	684.2521
this chancellor was a pleasant man	1444.5907
monseigneur au revoir monsieur bonacieux au revoir and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground	905.3857
i will not make a confidant of him alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain	434.7166
mazarin took the letter and read it thus mr	681.1049
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos	665.0978
what do you say m cavalcanti ah said he we have at <unk> <unk> tower at <unk> <unk> prison at <unk> the room of <unk> and paolo yes but you have not this little staircase said monte cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery	1345.3827
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme	672.6321
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase	2254.2144
<unk> meanwhile what of mercds	1016.0098
the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world	2118.9634
do you know she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us <unk> who is he whom do you mean the gentleman who receives us	834.9061
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house	1655.6503
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past	712.8997
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said dartagnan	777.1122
i have some <unk> coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow	1214.1604
sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise	363.6941
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with <unk> snares and traps	2149.8049
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of <unk> the mob retired	431.1828
the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and <unk> the water of the river looked black and deep	841.3175
i have been myself to the best <unk> of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence	778.0770
but suppose one pass as is <unk> in <unk> from the word itself to its softened <unk> then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an <unk> you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who <unk> them	436.7050
dartagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods	404.7603
gentlemen said andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said but said the irritated president you called yourself benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed corsica as your country i said anything i pleased in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the case	601.8560
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass what is to be done said porthos	327.4000
bon <unk> messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by dartagnan and porthos	658.6696
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister	885.6401
you have once before thrown yourself in my path	1080.5730
eugnie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn	1999.4414
my dear count we have only just begun what induces you to think so the knowledge that i have of the queens heart she will not rest contented beaten is she then preparing for a stroke i hope so come let us see what you know i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army ah	576.5471
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds	637.4389
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem <unk> engaged sir	1343.8531
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de trville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning	1189.2051
ah cried dartagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to <unk> in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i <unk> to make a reality of it well merit this pretended happiness then i am at your orders said dartagnan	847.0989
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the <unk> of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual <unk> storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne	644.7081
what shall we do yes why the same we had intended doing three days <unk> off <unk> you are not now going to be married you intend still listen louise	1805.3889
they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally <unk> then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person yes have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune yes i will name to you several sums which will increase by <unk> you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions yes there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation	412.5030
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dants sighed heavily	1098.0465
thats more time than we want	786.9541
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly	726.6755
i go said he i go at once how you will go said mme	327.7023
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage	514.1133
you received me very coldly	2011.8933
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours which you please monsieur said the light horseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven thirty five minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	567.3380
she scarcely resisted	1504.3573
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the night light held it up as if to test its <unk>	813.5974
almost an impossibility replied the major	1255.1697
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier	2062.4907
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as alberts prison and franz and the count followed him	822.0918
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	1039.0747
his mother the councillors old servant opened it	1180.5111
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the <unk> we sing in latin what says the abb asked athos quietly	1825.7064
you to interminable ineffaceable infamy you repeated i oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad	1838.9299
18 lake maggiore	1046.7419
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open	809.8356
oh leave me said i	219.5781
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dants as <unk> as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground	949.1483
come four	1270.8606
in two or three hours thought dants the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm	696.0829
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	1313.0032
sir he thus addressed dartagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell these words struck dartagnan like a thunderbolt	1238.2899
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me i pardon you monseigneur said bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry	697.7222
they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs the crowd began to murmur and approached the house	404.6520
my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks	1414.4313
my dear albert said debray rising it is half past two	979.1771
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court	770.5285
gaetano departed with the reply	700.4704
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders <unk> in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier	424.6934
to arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind	995.1192
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received	946.0630
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	1223.5793
everything was as athos had foreseen	336.6750
i am captain dants a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate the gendarme looked <unk> at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going on my honor i have no idea have you no idea whatever none at all that is impossible i swear to you it is true	1070.4705
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by dartagnan and porthos	1647.6354
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural	1517.9631
he escapes us so much the better muttered athos	1300.9199
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop	267.6608
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him <unk> is a <unk> offence i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal	824.0353
some of that at the bottom near the <unk>	926.4886
his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of dover	571.4576
dartagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal	222.3695
he had moreover <unk> bound on his feet by cords	103.4524
that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand	680.0204
aramis seized the <unk> and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and nearer	1434.5530
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment	1098.4031
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace	2414.3308
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction	1175.4283
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am	1344.2253
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	509.7586
1e3	90.5668
you are sure there is nobody there said the stranger	563.5522
since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the wall be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant	718.6963
read for yourself and judge porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur dartagnan who must follow the bearer well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied dartagnan	434.1073
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on limpartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor	705.3024
he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in miladys apartment which was to be seen through the blinds	1055.8777
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	684.2189
which route must i take demanded dartagnan in his turn	738.9522
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter	737.4464
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon	796.9074
zounds cried aramis i may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage	1036.2925
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital yes monseigneur you came through meung where something befell you	642.8497
suppose her majesty refuses oh said dartagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs	1335.6415
dartagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him	1493.0760
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	324.5525
my dear friend you are going to spoil <unk> is going on famously	616.8461
pray tell me how i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made <unk> is my lamp so saying the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public <unk>	1078.4856
dartagnan monsieur well then athos porthos aramis and dartagnan forward cried athos	520.6111
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done sire replied m de trville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king	1511.0471
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him	460.3744
do you understand that my dear <unk> horses he said but cant we have post horses they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting what are we to say to this asked franz	883.0396
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left <unk> yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses	836.5188
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos i shall go and shoot on his estate	1088.0468
i suffered frightful torments	516.3258
all the same resumed he after having <unk> his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows	2431.3772
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much	1035.8593
the comte de la fere athos	1740.7262
the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row	817.6187
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone	785.3149
the very same	756.9522
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich	987.8597
the scaffold will be ready by to morrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow what then said the king	675.7491
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily	1409.2494
imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags	1594.6647
it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from <unk> or <unk>	639.2445
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man	773.6439
and then <unk> <unk> on the earth a man without fortune a man without family a soldier accustomed to inns cabarets taverns and <unk> a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance <unk> about to partake of family meals to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is the more they please as old soldiers say	328.0507
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven	1175.7648
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice	424.7780
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy	742.5833
then m de trville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m de la trmouille to interrogate him himself	754.4881

no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de chteau renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the ministers <unk> and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo	572.3030

thats a frightful place that bastille	1163.2914
i didnt understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is you think so	515.7321
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	930.1916
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head	553.0291
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer	689.4916
and you go into that house cried he briskly	722.6541
he remembered the count of monte cristo	385.2248
she was a perfect <unk> a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a <unk> young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer	1772.7218
he is he would have added edmond dants but the count seized his arm and prevented him	476.3033
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling	633.0037
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the <unk> countenance of porthos	967.7675
at the first glance dartagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy	378.8445
no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened madame said monte cristo	784.5891
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos dartagnan became hourly more in love with milady	682.9799
but pardon said dartagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing mordaunt stopped short	450.4197
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind	575.8441
yes my friend and now now what asked porthos	406.3923
grimaud alone was calm as ever	904.0544
call the viscount and take the musket with you blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had <unk> by the name of his province	948.2051
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier	1855.2310
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to dartagnan a fine <unk> shining with <unk> and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a <unk> mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	1561.6109
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment	594.7959
if i only were a a baron dont you mean cried dartagnan finishing his friends sentence	691.7240
have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night no replied athos i thought it looked much the same as usual look again chevalier returned lord winter	486.0234
i believe everything said athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing	1857.9576
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where theres a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place oh	347.7999
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence	940.4355
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else tis well <unk> well replied m morrel	998.4492
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water	1595.2053
but the king is asleep i have something important to reveal to him can it not be put off till to morrow he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late come then said lord winter	469.4809
then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold	1366.2692
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis dartagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his <unk> course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de trvilles private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a <unk>	415.7603
to purchase back my liberty said the cardinal	759.2792
athos as a diplomatist	716.6533
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two <unk>	1060.9691
well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we french say	1584.7911
and so dants after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven	846.3564
another flash illuminated all around them	174.6778
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue	918.5969
come father added dants put this money back in your <unk> neighbor caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service no my boy no said caderousse	1695.5807
mme	27.9880
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love	2425.9517
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom <unk> to him	414.0964
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine upon my word the drum draws near said dartagnan	564.0111
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat	643.9008
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	612.4429
and i <unk> know a man does not arrive at the post i <unk> has not been kings attorney twenty five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies mine are numerous	1892.0115
that falls out <unk>	186.8365
they were approaching the scene of war and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow	736.7996
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m dpinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family	575.2150
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose	1099.5072
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me	259.5821
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to <unk> even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension <unk> every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	1071.1332
without that what would become of me it was one oclock in the morning	232.2017
what are you doing reverend sir	1098.1403
milady sprang toward him	1217.6049
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ah	762.8007
listen madame and recall your remembrances	1532.5192
sir said dartagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question	273.8079
god has so <unk> it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	810.9941
at the siege of <unk> i was in the trenches	1129.6575
their vows were sacred and irrevocable	879.3958
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte <unk> here is the priests certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment	902.3633
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill very probably answered the count	892.6114
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge <unk> a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones	697.0973
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are <unk> the hat for him and are there no cardinals that can fight	422.0385
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted <unk> she found this <unk> that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer	733.0831
the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of <unk> and <unk> while the women commented on the divorce of <unk>	368.9885
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so <unk> answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling the baroness became pale	1202.8462
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	1253.1046
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten	542.5532
of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom brisemont poured the <unk> into a glass and dartagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength	1589.3689
a friend a friend said peppino but where is the captain there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious <unk> hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings	505.9004
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape	508.0304
in ten minutes it would strike seven	1968.8231
maximilian said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood	561.4100
i am here what do you want with me and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume <unk> as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet	1001.6403
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur dartagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy	1248.9594
oh yes with all my soul well then listen valentine said the count i have a favor to ask of you of me	328.6508
he felt that influenced by her <unk> and coquettish disposition teresa might escape him	1073.3933
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital	1644.1271
a quarter of an hour afterward the <unk> of this craft took them all aboard	1911.1290
they were very happy	1017.8636

the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket	912.7657
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer	580.5805
then he will tell it me himself i doubt it my lord why do you doubt it because the secret does not belong to him because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen and he was alone in <unk> an enterprise like that no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united as if they had been one <unk> if their four hearts had <unk> in one breast you pique my curiosity dear rochefort pray tell me the whole story that is impossible but i will tell you a true story my lord pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal	355.8069
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe	642.0244
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives	912.8018
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of buckingham indeed monseigneur responded the mercer i have heard her pronounce all those names and on what occasion she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen she said that cried the cardinal with violence	869.3759
comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	2202.4038
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on	436.6511
haste said felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead then continued milady then i collected all my strength i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck	1124.6836
come raoul he said let us follow this man the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the <unk> step whilst athos and raoul descended	1393.4370
monsieur dartagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame <unk> with joy monsieur dartagnan	1544.2382
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos	423.3613

your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of <unk> the <unk> and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance <unk> me i should have liked something more in the manner of the <unk> of milo or <unk> but this chase loving <unk> continually surrounded by her <unk> gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of <unk> and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the <unk> of morcerfs remark	1928.4341
i cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old <unk> these ancient <unk> the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed <unk> opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the <unk> of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house	599.1526
they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries	1155.6447
the scotch my brothers	543.0102
athos counseled dartagnan to dismiss the fellow porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good <unk> first and aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him	896.7538
you evidently know her	1177.5725
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	688.2985
this was now all changed	662.9985
and is the reason known no how extraordinary	782.3521
ma foi yes like you i hesitated but the counts eloquence <unk> me let us go then said franz since you wish it but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso	1414.7030
a fearful day when to day we find our friends yes but under what circumstances tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done things look black enough replied porthos i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt silence cried the gascon do not utter that name but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english dartagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at <unk> of <unk> stupidity	1161.5580
but i think i have it said athos	179.7087
father said mercds stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the <unk> torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart	589.7534
eugnie	69.4877
has anyone brought a letter for me asked dartagnan eagerly	794.4745
then <unk> were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to <unk> my body forever	2411.3577

the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point	998.7611
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression	738.0876
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dants eagerly	852.9509
well for my part i shall go to bed said dartagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend	439.9539

his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one	848.2339
dants let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them	738.4724
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france	719.2071

she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	1458.1448

when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race i am highly flattered returned beauchamp	1087.1821
now to supper said aramis	441.3697
he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed <unk> <unk> <unk> english powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark	471.9380
you may now retire	1928.3651
yes a telegraph	1503.8073
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart	924.5865
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	523.4424
his gravity made him look older than he was well then if we can get athos all will be well	760.8975
follow me then said the abb as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dants	1046.9282
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of gods mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my fathers tomb by your fathers tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death	603.6446
a man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones	1282.8500
do not surrender egad	1317.0088
dartagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use	1223.6294
he motioned to valentine to approach	1133.8496
yes continued mme	2364.6775
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten oclock	1299.6030
i ask pardon of your eminence said dartagnan but i was so fatigued dont ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service dartagnan admired mazarins gracious manner	643.8077
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape dartagnan appeared to authorize the issue	718.0787
section 3 information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit 501c3 educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service	687.3710
it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme	351.7838
dartagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance	387.5146
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what	1375.5190
god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death	944.9044
alas	24.4118
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery	1568.5940
is the king wounded cried lord winter	657.6669
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself	734.4200
good god cried kitty there is my mistress calling me	944.5764
thanks to m morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust ah said villefort this seems to me the truth	314.2678
besides kitty will tell nothing will you kitty	904.0376
i am not a fighting man at all monsieur and i am afraid of the bastille hum said dartagnan	476.1949
of what companion are you speaking dear constance of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told everything her name her name cried dartagnan	467.5246
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m de saint mran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	488.4245
at length an honorable peer morcerfs acknowledged enemy ascended the <unk> with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived	242.5015
sblood does that astonish you and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method	849.3077
chapter lii	622.8428
have you lost it asked blaisois	689.7372
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	508.5049
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	707.6824
the chteau dif cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled	816.8428
but we know very well what had become of edmond	532.6426
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair	856.7206
i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercds rushed up the stairs and disappeared	471.1584
he entered after having twisted his mustache and <unk> his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions	2223.5486
i am going to <unk> i am going to fight answered porthos reddening	232.8498
if he is <unk> is what the other man <unk> see decidedly what to do with him what to do with him answered the prince	816.5341
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	390.8037
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two <unk> do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh	1125.9581
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary <unk> of scene and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity	648.6171
but aramis was livid	1219.3950
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection	878.0699
where do your excellencies wish to go asked he	713.8038
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight and what are your feelings said monte cristo turning to the young man	566.6456
he decided then to tell all	621.7683
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack	668.4285
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers	1425.1984
for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m de morcerf was so proud	624.7048
you cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger	2181.8799
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced	642.2733
this tranquillity proved one thingthat dartagnan did not yet know milady	2085.1494
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to <unk> to one who had been long <unk> and who was incapable of resuming the <unk> glow and hue of life	1098.6754
dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort	516.7722
ah im ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by <unk>	1222.1512
we do what we can and she rushed out of the room	307.5100
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of dartagnan who beheld in these two men <unk> and in their leader an <unk> jupiter armed with all his thunders	1344.8711
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts	530.9811
god will help you gentlemen in the name of heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words	494.7105
what m morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us no no said m morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away but i have no more ships and therefore i do not want any sailors no more ships returned penelon well then youll build some well wait for you i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i cannot accept your kind offer no more money	425.6094
the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse well transfer it to me at the price it cost you i was going to make you the offer my dear dartagnan giving you all the time necessary for <unk> me such a trifle how much did it cost you eight hundred livres here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said dartagnan taking the sum from his pocket i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems you are rich then said aramis	831.7757
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a <unk> of the army	411.7058
go to your father go and see mercds and afterwards come to me shall i row you ashore no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars	704.5148
1e6	31.6748
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church	423.1034
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence	622.3188
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis	406.6649
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property	962.3746
and you sir he said	153.3373
never never i believe you said mme	430.2143
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet <unk> like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis	617.3252
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the <unk> and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah	516.6014
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf	914.7216
<unk> noirtier stopped him at the last named sum	1009.5074
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him	825.5762
where does your highness wish to go to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case im your man i can trust youyou are a true frenchman i am an old soldier of rocroy my lord here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy	873.2526
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage	570.6687
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham	307.0023
sir thanks cried madame de chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have a noble heart i bring him to you madame said athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him till now i have watched over his education and i have made him i hope an accomplished gentleman but i am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction	491.7418
what has he done madame said dartagnan	326.8857
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	745.6099
you will find very few persons who will go and <unk> thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked	892.6714
it is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me <unk> is it madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted	172.9237
this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose colored glass	1208.7833
if you had only to deal with four men dartagnan i would allow you to go alone	358.1203
some days before the return of the emperor fernand was <unk>	1358.7788
you will find him quite enthusiastic upon what subject asked madame danglars	1259.3506
she had heard something said about supper	838.3832
on	67.3438
are you ill inquired the young man much alarmed	727.0851
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place	518.5535
do you know the count of monte cristo you mean monsieur zaccone i presume <unk> not his name monte cristo monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name well be it solet us not dispute about words and since m de monte cristo and m zaccone are the same absolutely the same let us speak of m zaccone agreed i asked you if you knew him extremely well who is he the son of a rich <unk> in malta i know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports however replied the abb with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest are you sure of what you assert what do you mean by that question understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity i ask if you are certain of it i knew his father m zaccone ah indeed and when a child i often played with the son in the timber yards but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count	1017.7142
there are yet five days left five days are more than i require	894.7626
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise what a strange man you are	671.8637
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to love any of us the old mans eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable <unk>	478.4071
what is that asked dartagnan	205.1300
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter <unk> and sundry other <unk> which you now adore did you like them	180.5540
reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming <unk> when they pass <unk> a multitude <unk> an emeute	158.7979
yes replied noirtier	1420.5801
things passed as on the night before	308.5990
three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear	1119.6805
ah madame said comminges hastening to dartagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector	462.9367
it is well said he kissing it it is my masters ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it	475.5015
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of february 1815 not quite twenty six murmured the voice at that age he cannot be a traitor oh no no cried dants	818.0145
1e9	12.3356
unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twenty five pistoles for which he had given his word	534.5644
porthos and aramis did the same	207.0898
the affair at armentieres asked he again	1833.5076
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moments repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england	558.7015
he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes	1237.4299
but not before one oclock replied dartagnan	467.9713
do you understand father	560.8741
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his <unk> would allow to the abb busoni who looked cold and calm as usual	1199.7643
gentlemen said he if monsieur dartagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur dartagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal you have my word monsieur and here is my sword this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey if it is for the purpose of <unk> milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find her what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly	407.1369
as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir	949.6331
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki	1893.5431
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself	390.4725
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune	814.7286
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction what	1490.2957
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups	2187.4290
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion	2288.5295
tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a <unk> became a number	1648.8457
i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone	881.0972
oh i confess it is all the same to me oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your <unk> and crimes would <unk> for it what you talk of <unk> madame <unk> lady macbeth	693.5011
i was pretty drunk yesterday dartagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous	732.0781
dartagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the enemy	576.6445
the inspector kept his word with dants he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond dants violent bonapartist took an active part in the return from elba	1082.1802
all the way along dartagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m de trville or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret affair	810.6755
do not let us <unk> but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil	1318.0415
has he a lady with him jesus	1034.3163
ah monsieur cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble	674.3097
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity	794.3303
those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror	944.5917
i am the abb faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this chteau dif since the year 1811 previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of <unk>	806.1349
how soft and perfumed was the air how lovely the blue heavens and star <unk> sky	378.3939
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter	280.2452
just so then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent	585.4533
<unk> an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel	1892.9635
dartagnan pursued his way	1357.7095
the superior education of dants gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy	1276.3925
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children rest assured put the gag in grimaud in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate	561.7886
and you monsieur du vallon yes you sir	781.0355
two persons passed near meallow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel oh yes very gloomy my friend	1088.9452
very and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists asked athos	711.8741
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance	1209.4199
the jailer came in the evening	482.0690
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half past four	1011.6425
you cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless noise	272.8104
but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour	634.3319
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends	145.7074
at the same time monte cristos voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue <unk> and thence to the avenue des champs lyses	653.0198
i only ask you one favor and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next speak to the master madame said felton happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor <unk>	376.9875
this man was the executioner	245.5859
five or six minutes elapsed	431.5030
is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	356.8531
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter	329.0610
i must leave you said du tremblay i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner	540.0704
at eccuis the same scene was repeated	1470.5486
gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw	460.5070
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured	1379.9219
you must love somebody no i am alone in the world then you will love me	439.9946
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	876.4911
i have no business in london but others wish that you should go there but who are those others	550.8854
bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience	728.1663
how i have suffered said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient <unk> charmed all whom she wished to destroy	1144.2479
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in ritas left breast	1212.9180
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all <unk> franz dpinay ah true said debray you did fight some time ago about what <unk> the devil take me if i remember returned chteau renaud	2391.4963
he knew that there was a trap door communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	806.9969
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted	600.7659
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready your pardon said richelieu surprised	997.4769
athos made him a sign to go to dartagnans residence and bring back some clothes	690.4243
it might be called a magnificent prison	1079.8560
each fish was brought over in a <unk> filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine	1374.4484
presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault	842.4287
with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and i will get you the torch you ask for	504.0120
nothing at all thats a capital arrangement	1276.8033
bridle in mouth said dartagnan	336.8171
each was accompanied by two priests	1254.8889
and now you are assembled gentlemen said dartagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis	1410.9641
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majestys pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur dartagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said dartagnan bowing	764.0883
i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even csar borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the days these two <unk> passed together went quickly	1248.1180
or at least i will <unk> he drew kitty to him	1159.3098
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim m danglars <unk> sir replied danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog i kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness	458.1658
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel <unk> <unk> did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage	979.5876
monsieur dartagnan is not with me he serves under monsieur dessessart well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company that same evening m de trville announced this good news to the three musketeers and dartagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning	498.2030
<unk> everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful <unk> sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold <unk> down upon me and the most splendid <unk> about to be entered into	79.0071

teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing room	1465.3855
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door	727.7438
and you i am lord de winter baron <unk> well then i am your servant monsieur baron said dartagnan though you have names rather difficult to recollect and touching his horse with the spur he <unk> back to paris	964.8048
look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its <unk> and seizing the bridle of athoss horse	1409.9491
it was evident that the cardinal was <unk> beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to <unk> them in her memory when they should be spoken	434.5549
you know there are different sorts that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of <unk> with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the <unk>	1103.9194

what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day	910.9985
yes see i send a ball into the moat a man is there who <unk> it up the ball contains a letter	965.7553
his arms became stiff his legs lost their <unk> and he was almost breathless	1244.8713

each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different <unk> of beauty	1379.9153
eh	39.6380
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent	582.2395
it was a barn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without <unk> on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a <unk> quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day	1113.5219

felton remained in the corridor	454.6773
but i tell you that i am the mistress of the house gentlemen	189.5815
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any <unk> method of correction	645.9796
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife <unk> of all crime in the eyes of the world	2493.2490
keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it	1261.3356
peste thats a fine age replied porthos	1166.0353
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris	615.3273
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m franz	485.4518

at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercds at the second he reminded her that he loved her	283.7875

if a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater terror	1072.0575
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away	439.6448

at length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained	1033.3264
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars	474.4000
my adored valentine words cannot express one half of my satisfaction valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier	1336.2861
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an understanding	667.3674

i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear dherblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by dartagnan the division being made by the light of bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis	1026.4786
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides <unk> troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to dartagnan and porthos well search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy and i feel no doubt that thanks to dartagnans ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master that poor planchet	1869.9840

he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable <unk> a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme <unk> might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die	821.4041
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of danglars what	647.4404

how very astonishing cried he at length	1137.3492
<unk> i awoke as the clock was striking six	908.4869
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only chteau renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	611.4318
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo the history is ended chapter 78 we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him	1950.2897

she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to <unk> it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him	625.3587

the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abb in a monks dress with a <unk> on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages	1267.3240
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of hayde as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a <unk> succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	616.3469
darminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion	935.7758

if they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them death and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of <unk> of old <unk> but i being only a little child was terrified by this <unk> courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us	731.3157
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her thank you sir said davrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it	531.5772

here father here he said take <unk> it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin	758.2328

he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	460.1156
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his <unk> the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other	1476.6899

notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the <unk> of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet	2002.5070

i confess this is the <unk> thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity	1720.6823
do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse	186.7333
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable <unk> of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the <unk> of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable	931.3234
he placed the young girl again on the <unk> lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole <unk> remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	1320.2495
his face a little <unk> had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	2076.8210
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad <unk>	309.6612
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature	1554.3950
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury	667.9755
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	2255.0420
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	915.0361
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to <unk> death	1529.2904
in <unk> a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada on the 25th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the <unk> time the papers i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hands and i fell asleep about three oclock in the afternoon	713.4462

the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan <unk> we may get up a striking <unk> after the manner of that splendid picture by lopold robert	1427.7129
the baron was completely roused	1533.9238
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them	549.1699
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	406.6777
to speak to you about me of what else do you imagine he would speak to me	298.8145
i do not know you i am said i the little abb who reads lives of the saints and <unk> judith into verse ah ah	828.0037
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	349.0219
certain dants could not escape the gendarmes released him	1223.0338
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterdays <unk>	482.2205
my left side still pains me are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant egad didnt you hear	1141.6815
but there must be some cause for this strange scene the count of morcerfs adventure <unk> the young man have you anything to do with it it was through hayde that the chamber was informed of his fathers treason indeed said morrel	1131.2352
never mind	2290.3572
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen he stopped at the end of the corridor and said i can count upon you gentlemen can i not we do not give ourselves twice over said dartagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall obey very well then said mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till i come back and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door	266.8513
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker his banker	407.2884

the morrels have been <unk> from father to son and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at <unk> pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted	803.1273
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis	326.1469
in which we hear tidings of aramis	897.4083
will you speak he said	179.0040
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to dartagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel	715.7025
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and dartagnan and advanced toward the door	454.8531
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment chapter xxxix	948.1388
come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of <unk> bed	317.6816
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	335.2462
i have imparted it to no one but my god and that in my prayers i ask for no more	383.6768
no you are at your journeys end how monsieur	899.6779
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice and he is in the fort levque said the king	308.0446
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	705.4100
he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and <unk> black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	231.6686
he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like <unk> brutus have kissed his mother earth it was dark but at eleven oclock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second <unk>	1145.3413
and then he was older than any of us added dartagnan	563.3016
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand	478.9088
try and find a <unk> is one by that <unk> which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak indeed	789.6263
we might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the <unk>	547.6108
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	1519.0261
she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her	467.3705
i see it and i thank you for it	202.0599
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his <unk> drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader pleases	1416.2788
they spread their cloaks	962.7027
she fainted	727.2242
dartagnan turned to look at his friends	345.6142
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness	839.6431
chapter xxxviii	524.8965
it is said that mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of <unk> <unk> memoirs	558.3041
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	1077.7078
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to <unk> would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood with the queen sir replied athos in his calm <unk> voice	930.3304
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution	797.4164
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	434.2340
at this time athos came up to dartagnan	323.8530
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured dartagnan	1036.4935
why it is a rank of itself in france and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year a hundred thousand francs	350.4270
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions half reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile	1164.5416
you are right welcome	2423.0361
<unk> well baron said he here i am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker	786.5115
in twenty four hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards	1081.3651
dants reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could <unk> from all these men if he gave utterance to the one <unk> thought that pervaded his heart but far from <unk> this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his <unk> and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	920.3489
i shall faint again monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial	1260.1152
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette	752.1719
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugnie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him	401.5598
he might have been taken for a statue	690.9789
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton	1373.2534
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him	1068.7755
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite	1357.1322
then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned	399.4684
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here <unk> the whole of the 500000 livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never <unk> is a <unk> where he wins without playing and is no <unk> when he loses the baroness became enraged	1079.1564
why was i a prisoner i do not know said mercds	260.1429
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	1231.2576
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on	808.5573
the queen had at first positively refused but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly	1306.1367
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord dartagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminences order and that i shall await him at the stables the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter	527.8151
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	983.4807
it was intensely dark still ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees	1303.7604
well monsieur he is still here ah pardieu my dear dame said dartagnan springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life where is this dear aramis	626.3017
bertuccio appeared	1888.5287
you foolish fellow said athos laughing	745.0737
the first person to attract the attention of dants as he landed on the canebire was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon	567.0892
mme	49.7650
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy	370.7353
yes very well	639.9072
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money	1583.4670
the general depended much on it he even came to force m danglars	883.8135
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed <unk> followed behind	819.1645
ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on and he sighed deeply	655.2693
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports	713.6054
i have not a penny about me you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms which that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket hold your tongue imprudent man	492.7736
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners mordaunt completely deceived by the <unk> civility of dartagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away no replied dartagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour	1471.1055
hayde would it please you not to leave me i am young gently replied hayde i love the life you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die you mean then that if i leave you hayde i should die yes my lord do you then love me oh valentine he asks if i love him	386.0797
doctor my house is accursed what said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid yes doctor cried villefort clutching his hair yes davrignys look implied i told you it would be so then he slowly uttered these words who is now dying in your house	877.3705
he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring	543.1649
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhne and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew	1108.1741
bonacieux what is it it is the uniform of the cardinals guards	247.3204
letters had been despatched to m cavalcanti as the counts father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave <unk> at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres	1343.8422
have you seen him since i left him	335.2093
now attach him to our party	1217.3384
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands	714.0316
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel	555.0242
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	761.5137
had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution	1012.5441
go sir go but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it	786.8832
come milady opened the window and made a sign to mme	365.7023
although m de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air	1157.1448
i neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me	1475.3835
ah said he involuntarily following noirtiers eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed	974.2635
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day	526.1307
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited	1642.8577
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	877.9175
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another	278.7580
have they allowed the headsman to escape suddenly the dull beating of muffled <unk> filled the square	913.7066
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	375.0802
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo	541.0369
touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh	686.8906
<unk> and before dants could open his <unk> he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the <unk> he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	1673.3240
<unk> saint <unk> monsieur de trville as the king my father would have said	947.3903
from <unk> if you will it must be farther off than even that but what do i know of your parisian husbands oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray	667.8679
i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper hands and whither am i to go to london i go to london	390.2088
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession	406.3877
and is it your cook who <unk> these pills asked beauchamp	1550.3321
madame said athos passing his arm under that of dartagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman	455.8918
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	1156.7643
four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers	1011.6730
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth my fifty recruits from the chevalier dhumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks and where are you going to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him	1327.3254
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol	930.2275
good	20.3741
what matters it about <unk> is a name not a thing mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken broussel was a thing not a name	905.1047
but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass	502.0429
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbs plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he	1012.8044
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the <unk> analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief	834.2208
if you deprive me of that take away my life also we are forbidden to shed your blood and by whom are you forbidden by him we obey you do then obey someone yes a chief i thought you said you were the chief so i am of these men but there is another over me and did your superior order you to treat me in this way yes but my purse will be exhausted probably come said danglars will you take a million no two <unk>	649.9636
ifaith colonel said dartagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast	773.3425
before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a <unk> a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him	669.3117
no said danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer	1128.6328
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin	1497.5954
we will not <unk> you to help us we <unk> no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice	1630.9420
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	652.0060
it contained my fortune bills upon spain asked the disturbed host	2445.5090
six of his eminences guards arrest six of his majestys musketeers	1092.7360
thin and lanky the executioner said dartagnan and aramis at the same time	347.2511
the jailer went away shaking his head	1710.2610
this announcement was received in silence	1191.8119
besides by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux interrupted dartagnan	733.1027
help <unk> me your assistance noirtier looked at the dictionary	1332.2694
bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor and those of the first floor you know they are never closed	1337.3500
my political opinions replied dants	96.4662
eh monsieur said he addressing dartagnan dont you remember that face which is blinking yonder no said dartagnan and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that visage parbleu i believe it is not said planchet	714.5659
he had not seen morrel	434.1417
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield <unk>	1682.2356
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon	1138.1278
you understand that interested as i am in this affair i cannot see it in the same light as you do	330.0340
i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father	1050.3464
where is the prisoner said a voice	194.2280
there is a carriage coming said chteau renaud	796.1763
well i call you and say to you friend felton john my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman	634.7398
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who <unk> for the kings death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without <unk> in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and <unk> from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the <unk> adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed rene you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint mrans that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past	456.5391
morrel was <unk> to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been	843.5538
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demi god has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the <unk> from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man	407.8318
ah	20.1184
no no i would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise	600.1989
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint mran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep	578.7446
the flight	1220.9976
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face <unk> both gravity and sweetness of expression	2028.6747
louis xviii	330.3761
yes i understand my lord observes that there will be enough to go around we shall take to ourselves the <unk> and the rope replied the duke	706.7615

about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face	929.3045
now then said andrea while dressing himself ill wait till he leaves and then ill slip away <unk> and saying this andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain	2433.8562
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate	579.1946
let us strive i beseech <unk> us strive to be cheerful yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind	503.0901
olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use	410.8404
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke	1500.0811
28 rue de la fontaine	639.2563
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one	1149.2864
you hear comminges said the queen	548.9955
noirtiers eye remained immovable	1224.7264
the king wishes to get a sleep one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone	449.7203
hey	77.5732
dartagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	451.1654
and now where is he gone inquired dartagnan	646.9485
neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her	507.0277
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe i ought rather to say what i know what you know and even what i am sure of and of what are you so sure i would say that i know this great lady you yes i and how do you know her oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion speak	710.9816
valentine tell him if you love maximilian the count felt his heart dilate and throb he opened his arms and hayde uttering a cry sprang into them	600.8679
valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses <unk> sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husbands arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow	1235.1887
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you he is right thought athos	753.4308
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus <unk> and will not comply with any of my fancies that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing	1036.1071
if we cannot we will do without him	464.1967
next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault	982.1020
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset	876.0624
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it	1469.7052
peppino followed danglars	1786.7003
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	625.6815

some voices even added long live the marshal but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating <unk> and others imitating the sound of the trumpet	874.0917
no count of monte cristo added debray	846.8376
after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously	1167.3477
come calm yourself and reckon them <unk>	670.6110
impossible the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently	1637.3284
thou man of noble heart woe is me	797.2164
there remains the valise added porthos	1999.2698
then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white <unk> their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming <unk> which the gods could not resist but which saints <unk> and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a <unk> grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss	685.9091
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table	533.4227
false	18.1537
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back	571.9415
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money no to the cardinal its the same thing cried the young woman	383.4879
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which	616.5609
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had <unk> the abb adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit	1057.4967
during this time porthos played close	1381.6112
<unk> yes indeed sir continued eugnie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	1080.9729
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here this voice the sound of which reached dartagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten	423.8232
the king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust	896.7855
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the <unk> of two old oak trees the refuge of the <unk> startled by the travelers were in deep shadow	1064.4316
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain <unk> and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is <unk> to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study	573.8619
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this <unk> morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was <unk> gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	593.5366
very pretty but to the great astonishment of dartagnan the shutter remained closed	545.2325
dartagnan relates that on his first visit to m de trville captain of the kings musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was <unk> the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis	446.8380
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too <unk> i go away enchanted farewell then or rather au revoir for i hope we shall meet again whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminences orders that will be frequently i assure you for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation oh	1202.3730
alas i understand think of the offense you have committed toward me madame	621.1576
is he some minister out of office oh no not at all vicomte athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him do gentlemen then make verses asked raoul naively i thought it was <unk> so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases <unk> monsieur de <unk>	641.1323
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered	483.6822
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house take care said madame de villefort the kings attorney is here ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration your declaration said villefort	477.6877
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope	707.9417
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked gondy	488.9001
you know something about him do you not madame	395.5115

for peppino cried andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged	999.6168
it was midnight	1248.8379
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires to this athos replied quietly we also have money <unk> i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs	718.8923
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years then no misfortune has happened to you and what misfortune could happen to me	522.7924
i swear it was time for you to come back la ramee and i was eager to see you again monseigneur is too good said la ramee flattered by the compliment	375.6271
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire	342.4899
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large	471.1388
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlinis rear when he fell	1620.2358
the bastion st gervais replied dartagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen was that affair hot yes moderately so	613.4527
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes	873.3600
a mass of straight black hair <unk> all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased <unk> to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and <unk> for every forbidden enjoyment	462.0574
and his name said he	171.5313
you know it is not my fault said morrel	386.3117
he stopped however at the door for an instant	478.5278
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	1864.1687
be tranquil murmured milady i will avenge youand cruelly peste said dartagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come it took some time for dartagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished	2215.6550
what shall we do	461.8786
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful chapter liv	1331.2256
i will lay a wager that twas that saint <unk> porthos who performed this feat	1366.3956
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means and i have none either said the queen	502.8450
i do not reject it altogether said athos but i wish to remind aramis that he cannot quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours after the messenger has set out all the <unk> all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us gentlemen said dartagnan what porthos says is full of sense ah ah	874.0754
depart then depart i implore you oh how beautiful you are thus	953.9565
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse you know resumed dartagnan that she has had leave to return to france yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice oh this time returned aramis i havent seen her she is much changed in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance	894.2596
in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to <unk> a coming storm	800.3312
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege never till then had a more brutal accusation or <unk> insults tarnished kingly majesty	509.9772
egad	40.4942
what more do you want i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person absolutely then as i said before <unk> well i am ready to marry m cavalcanti but what are you up to ah that is my affair	591.5179
how is there still time asked the man in the cloak	269.7535
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something <unk> and irresolute	451.2177
a loud cry could be heard by her	771.0486
my faith	671.9759
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he <unk> is merely from the circumstance of his being your <unk> who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really	1085.5566
at last the half hour struck	759.0008
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a <unk> of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an <unk>	637.4496
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet	971.0055
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination	598.7508
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in mens clothes	1243.7080
ah	32.4133
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial <unk> <unk>	153.6849
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name	722.0437
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten well madame in that case my <unk> know that i am very bold to offer advice to your <unk> advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom	745.6749
give your orders and we will execute them then open the door directly peppino obeyed	1119.4435
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink	1748.4235
to horse my friends to horse and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to bthune	583.2598
have a care cried porthos to his opponent ive still two pistols charged the more reason you should fire the first cried his foe	782.6876
as to dartagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive	929.3546
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire	1120.9579
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	587.9766
what does scandal signify to me	2058.0608
the eight guards were at their posts	2255.6528
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five thousand	589.2221
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur darminges and beat a retreat	512.4350
he has he is an abb ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	975.7407

cardinal i must have the queens papers but how to take them sire	528.6692
why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob indeed i do not know what he is he has three unlimited <unk> on me one on rothschild one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100000 francs m de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration	363.3237
good said monte cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier and you leave us said julie at a moments warning	1056.0349
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort	1078.8864
move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded	683.5849
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor	1361.6716
it is not gods will that they should be accomplished	631.9200
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dants the features of his conductor an under jailer ill clothed and of sullen appearance	1907.6947
hayde took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes	1094.4777
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg electronic works	1594.1902
he made his way along the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus <unk> in torture	1358.2411
at the end of half an hour or thereabouts a clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to conduct m bonacieux to the chamber of examination	722.8246
yes indeed thats the right thing	907.3613
by degrees everyone awoke	612.8500
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and <unk> on the gold embroidered cloth	483.4327
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness	352.7294
madame de saint mran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint mran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m de villefort or rather mademoiselle <unk> still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to <unk> livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp	848.6288
at last louis xiii	939.4682
i believed you dead why did i survive you	852.6464

she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep	958.5665
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	676.1736
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams	412.6541

i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence	421.7576
i dont want any supper said caderousse	1705.6343
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately	753.1119
i feel easy replied porthos	1835.9878
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur dherblay and myself to do in your service	398.0617
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day dartagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails	568.6141
i do assure you <unk>	371.9251
supposing this person wearied at the <unk> of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to <unk> if the count should have no time to run to her <unk> if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel	2145.9294
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview	1059.0028
well then said milady i confide in my brother i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again	368.1531
m danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	290.3005
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret	377.5730
as captain of the musketeers m de trville had the right of entry at all times	466.1062
sir said he here is monsieur dartagnans answer but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos	507.3951
she was still exceedingly handsome	302.8986
ah	74.6413
let us get ready gentlemen but this second letter said athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened	523.0198
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated	1127.3021
ah monseigneur continued bonacieux throwing himself at his eminences feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world <unk> the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man the cardinal has touched me with his hand	973.2695
well i shall write to the abb i shall hold him responsible for his <unk> misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination	1197.4696
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the <unk> of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey	1597.1737
and me too said aramis	374.1368
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	790.6240
what	54.3953
for example look at the <unk> procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count	1317.6501
on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides yes added athos i now ask you dartagnan what side you are on	472.9073
dartagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now dont you think monsieur that woods are like churches how so planchet because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other but why did you not dare to speak aloud <unk> you are afraid afraid of being heard	451.5645
dartagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object	251.3973
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	1101.0985
so much the better	414.5134
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de cond although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort delbeuf and de bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken <unk> you going to try to take charenton such are my orders sir since you command the cavalry pardon me i am commander in chief so much the better	447.3045
dartagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	681.8803
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape	497.8553
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had <unk> it	510.4285
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	813.6684
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	641.3069
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers thats all well cried dartagnan	990.5403
my father said hayde raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something <unk> gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of hayde at this moment she appeared like a <unk> <unk> a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	1123.9562
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerfs apartments	593.1917
villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders	598.5210
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye not on your own account surely replied monte cristo for a man is above that sort of thing oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head	627.9661

young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe upon my honor said the prince	436.6732
the queen breathed more freely	495.7044
aha what blood at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	607.7707
i did replied the count	240.6917
it is singular said dartagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i cannot yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised anchor	519.4517
edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the <unk> was silent there	1409.2361
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her	717.0460
upon my word	531.5809
fortunately deceived by dartagnans trick they neglected to reload their guns	1148.5475
i will complain to monsieur de trville and monsieur de trville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that dartagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage	479.5909
now will you make me a report of all that has happened why i have related the events to you	317.3985
it is only shown to me to terrify me thats all you are mistaken	741.7078
an instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four oclock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house	1318.1969
hes not more cunning than de richelieu was	740.0901
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter	773.4778
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the <unk> of this womans heart	2196.1978
edmond resigned the lugger to the masters care and went and lay down in his <unk> but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment	816.5181
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and <unk> like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead	653.9518
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night	1672.9586
nothing could turn him from his purpose	642.2189
the one you bought will then become useless to you nearly so and you selected it yourself with the greatest care	516.1619
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	945.8344
yours cried she throwing back her <unk> which i alone perhaps have not forgotten	1646.0358
do you know him	200.6496
weak and <unk> footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase	1845.1637
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am mme	408.5913
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornlie her confidential maid	1409.3099
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time	474.5422
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face	522.3623
well said the count you do not get out m <unk> are going to stay in the carriage then	575.6527
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain	693.8363
is life worth the trouble of so many questions	1132.4572
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone	465.7865
important and urgent said he	378.5723
peste you come to your <unk> quickly	170.9771
twelve hours delay was all that was <unk> is until nine the next morning	1602.1683
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his	398.2468
ah	76.1009
i have never seen her from that day	423.1243
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day	952.7005
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again	583.8261
it would be impossible to describe mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men	581.8912
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was all	459.6041
darling replied valentine has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is <unk> up in two words wait and hope <unk> et <unk> <unk> 1 the wicked are great drinkers of water as the flood proved once for all 2 <unk> in <unk>	1089.0334

but how do you know all this how do i know it yes how do you know it	316.3576
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven <unk> however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de trville will think of this insult offered to his protg monsieur de trville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de trville	477.2369
shall i give you the change my officer said the host	291.1336
i dont need the quarter of such a <unk> who am still only in the <unk> by selling my saddles i shall procure it	1760.6759
bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great	648.4071
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la <unk> precisely said the cardinal	393.3900
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	518.4420
in after years whether he had forgotten this <unk> of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band	1831.6008
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris	561.9328
what are you thinking of dartagnan he began	343.9181
god will punish you	1026.5614
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor	687.6359
dartagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a <unk> only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it	765.7971
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused	427.9999
before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die	902.3765
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her	633.0839
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed	500.6898
but how do you procure a light oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little <unk> which was readily supplied dants laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind	1451.8811
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is <unk> in <unk> said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and <unk> he has invented a new system of <unk> which he is seeking to bring to perfection how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect	1427.9792
but here is the letter very well said the prince give it to me later	321.3341

i command you not to <unk> nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings	695.0037
i beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but i dont think im many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of saint john <unk> say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan tis i who am too soon	926.2673
upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom house officers and two or three <unk> heavily armed	907.3510
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead you make me tremble said the young girl	772.1718
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so	426.8551
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter	1215.5350
let us go to monsieur de beaufort the two friends went to the hotel de vendome	463.2559
well ever since then the infernal project has been <unk> in her brain ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live <unk> to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me command me <unk> am i to do you must blindly take what i give you alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die you must not confide in <unk> even in your father my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her hands	1447.6213

there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him <unk> in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze	663.1395
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken	699.0563
he consigned his unknown <unk> to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of <unk>	2293.3865
i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday did you fear that we should forget it you are very good madame but m de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain and said villefort is it at your house in the champs lyses that you receive your visitors no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more <unk> is in the country in the country yes where is it then	412.6941
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom <unk> was a painted <unk>	1131.1516
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m de villefort but like the feudal barons who <unk> against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	374.8097
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman	763.6807
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina	2414.6738
poor edward is as much m noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m franz m noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more	1142.5892
at <unk> planchet who led the column turned to the left	2146.8967
i was present during his last moments	1204.5520
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near	758.4881
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	399.7588
alas no i know not	246.6355
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed	727.7706
morbleu monsieur said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you perhaps said athos	374.2644

her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory	938.9443
that i am exceedingly disquieted sire really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of <unk> and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty <unk> is not a thing to be feared then of what other <unk> are you afraid my dear blacas sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is <unk> in the south well my dear duke replied louis xviii i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction man of ability as he was louis xviii	1212.4270
gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows	554.5562
everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse	1178.0471
ordinarily m de villefort made and returned very few visits	935.6820
i have not time for <unk> affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but i make an agreement with the man who <unk> up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the <unk> that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz	864.8294
let us then take advantage of it then aloud well my dear la ramee	851.1937

this movement revealed the spot where winters body had fallen	1016.1187
there you see it will not take long yes but do this and you will have <unk> and all the rest the shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the right hand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad	364.6776
the steward gave him a gun this was what vampa longed for	1390.2627

the hungry friends followed by their lackeys were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with for according to the advice of aramis it was prudent to <unk> <unk> right and left in prosperity in order to reap a few in time of need	1195.8997
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility	598.1595
i became very pale i felt my legs fail me i sought for a reply but could find <unk> was silent	1320.1959
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugnie became uneasy	280.0109
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof	1181.8071

good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	487.6582

ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she <unk> the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise darmilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine	520.3732
