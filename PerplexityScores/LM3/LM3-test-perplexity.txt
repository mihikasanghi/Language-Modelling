i am determined to tell them all about it be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety	831.9291
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	1271.3199
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him	459.3661
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which dartagnans letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood	392.2003
at this moment one of the door keepers brought in a letter for the president	365.0071
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine danglars bit his lips	550.7417
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods	943.8632
i had no longer any wish to live for myself i have lived for him	476.3598
monsieur said dartagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat	421.1206
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	1571.7910
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his <unk> quickly threw him on his back	861.3037
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself yes	537.4044
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else they continued their route	386.2144
ho said he good advice advice of a friend	458.9976
it is astonishing said he	465.5325
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by <unk> a paul <unk> a <unk> two by <unk> <unk> a raphael a <unk> <unk> a <unk> and two or three by <unk> worth looking at stay said debray i recognize this <unk> ah indeed yes it was proposed for the museum which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo	815.7199
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	728.9598
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away <unk> and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo	686.5671
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	1990.9066
ill manage it somehow you will see but said dartagnan now i think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning to night nothing at all said groslow	780.0050
adieu till we meet again	1513.4604
dartagnan then looked around attentively	2122.5332
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for <unk> his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor	530.2076
ah he has a niece interrupted porthos	893.5960
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay	338.5940
you were writing i your fingers are stained with ink ah true i was writing	1212.7665
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away	1044.5173
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction	712.4803
march it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked dartagnan	1785.3479
what the devil would you have me do with that said the englishman	202.3301
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that dartagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place	1588.3848
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it to morrow raoul didnt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	1186.8824
aha said groslow on account of political opinions	1955.7953
we can talk of it afterward then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed	788.6096
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	553.1096
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	834.5013
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	540.2365
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england	582.3748
oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard	546.6497
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st louis above the order of notre dame du mont <unk> and st lazare and gave it to <unk> the meanwhile take this cross sire said villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers cross ma foi said louis xviii take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another	599.4933
my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this <unk> but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious	752.4464
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	767.1918
bravo	35.3158
<unk> so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven <unk> and allied armies <unk> that man	751.8370
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who <unk> me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen	621.6735
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans	1162.6725
mordioux answered dartagnan i believe we must	527.6074
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose	359.2407
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek yes such a one as would be made by the <unk> of a ball was he not a fine looking man yes of lofty stature yes of pale complexion and brown hair yes yes that is he how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man	774.3632
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken and what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his <unk> run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked	679.8347
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded <unk> brother entered dartagnans service	888.5131
the only thing to mislead the <unk> would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself	888.0006
that would carry you to the end of the world	223.5895
a cloud settled on his brow <unk> decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there	2032.0497
explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt everything because having neither arms nor password we <unk> take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms yes but before we can kill <unk> he will be hard to kill that <unk> will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like <unk> we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun	211.0055
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary yes so it is between perfectly upright people one word more said monte cristo	1942.5991
i detest her from antipathy or rather by instinct perhaps so	2115.6360
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this	411.2585
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame	594.0131
eh no	438.3703
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	597.6751
at this moment ali entered	1179.0823
dartagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet <unk>	988.7137
read and answer or i will blow out your brains the sergeant saw that dartagnan was in earnest	607.2493
the duc de beaufort	687.8316
yes said porthos but there are the equipments that is very true	407.9734
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine	1116.5024
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners	327.8782
it is my fault madame said raoul	657.7437
anne de bueil	305.0947
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the <unk> of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way	1200.3967
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with kisses	992.2261
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades	559.7629
bonacieux who had sent for m laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time	534.0676
but since you possess that virtue why the devil dont you make use of it with respect to her majesty	565.7015
it was about half past nine	1442.6812
dont forget the signal jesus seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the self same air	1258.9441
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy	1102.8457
dartagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own	1730.7147
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest <unk> would have been	1415.6309
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	953.0309
i was trying on my wedding suit	2029.0482
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows	2182.0544
oh it would be a sacrilege	636.9902
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these <unk> very much as the slaves were treated in <unk> <unk> whose masters made them <unk> doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti	1289.6554
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple <unk> only i want it julie made a pretence to feel for the key	446.5024
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers	553.8807
name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends well said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de <unk> monsieur de <unk> monsieur de <unk> the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said dont you know a gentleman named athos milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks	292.5479
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel	1392.9872
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo	1180.0682
is monsieur your cousin	1570.8335
ifaith aramis believe me there is little left to regret	589.0952
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh <unk> my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the <unk> name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife	1216.4727
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm	238.0180
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	1584.3870
milady uttered a stifled groan	1274.0101
i said a million replied danglars with the confidence of ignorance	475.6237
the cardinals guards and m de la <unk> people retreated into the htel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them	1394.8384
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish	1599.6453
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him	2383.6829
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry out	782.0869
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre at one oclock this morning she had not returned my god	791.2433
<unk>	36.0603
then he saw through the whole thing	515.0211
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon <unk> veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	745.7009
to arms cried grimaud	1492.4092
what were you doing replied she	416.2664
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	377.7547
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peters by daylight	1562.7476
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the dukes tone toward <unk> that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine have you enemies then asked richelieu	1228.3976
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer	1154.1202
what do you desire a bed my lord replied dartagnan	440.3758
who are you asked the man	154.9419
there will be eleven crowns gained it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in dartagnans purse	791.6561
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and <unk> a deep seated hatred of <unk> were the elements of private and public life displayed by m de villefort	178.7233
bonacieux	61.4105
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly	379.1940
quiet was at length restored	1301.5577
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning	388.3374
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you <unk> is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached	601.7834
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet	613.9815

his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea	737.9395
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices asked valentine	375.5840
either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk the first cur the first priest you may meet	625.6686
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks	2142.0986
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings example	471.5607
where am i and why am i here	250.1591
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine	546.6273
what convent	1594.4228
in fact the blow was direct and severe	944.8954
nay said she do not smile it ill <unk> with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart	567.4714

just heaven what have i read cried the duke	420.7533
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected <unk>	1308.1744
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly	792.4451
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m de villefort	676.2775

the dull driver smoking his pipe was <unk> along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station	333.7877

while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years	554.4748
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the <unk> fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her	1355.0829
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things what have you done oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor well monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post	391.5470

intact my dear friend besides the harness of your <unk> and mine but what is the use of harnesses without horses i have an idea about them athos you make me shudder listen to me	1120.2450
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around	515.5752
poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately it is a poor lame post horse in what state was the house when you left all was quiet but on returning from m beauchamps i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	364.4623

at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them	593.1680
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the counts manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum	332.9040
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again	381.4882

yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms	398.7555
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking	1060.1261

have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a state councillor then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly	426.8807
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois <unk> enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	1389.5734
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the <unk> structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground	1418.8703
<unk> <unk> undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely	633.6459
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	579.8503
well let me see what can you want that begins with n	1011.9026
nevertheless he understood it all but was deaf	666.1951
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise	401.6483
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and <unk> to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon good said comminges	624.6455
i cannot see help help my friends	1451.0028
thats well	677.3483
dartagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the door	918.9220
your pardon sir said milady with mildness	1891.8031
possibly said danglars was not this murdered man an old galley slave <unk> yes replied the count a felon named caderousse danglars turned slightly pale andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room	1990.9929
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works	1280.2644
he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office	1205.6444
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts	1054.5428
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	326.3329
the next morning he gathered an <unk> of pieces of slate and began	1441.8870
ah	22.0429
nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dants was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abb might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing	1002.4507
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination a problem my dear count for <unk> my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear	1312.6307
the young man knelt down	1708.3130
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	606.9199
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered	583.2006
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin	1524.0810
three blows were struck upon the panel of the door	689.1330
i am come to fetch you monsieur dartagnan from whom his eminence sent me tell my lord that im going to sleep and i advise him as a friend to do the same his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly the devil take mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time	627.8099
the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished	657.9677
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	556.9312
the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirty five	529.4210
i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution i told you true replied he coldly	307.4526
why should my father <unk> the all <unk> before whom others were accustomed to <unk> who had taken for his device they hate me then they fear me it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect	59.7847
dartagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul	1079.9991
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more who i am madame	449.7982
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home	494.7212
why edmond dants and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed <unk> as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	450.1456
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind <unk> as the body does after extreme fatigue	784.4623
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	521.0778
chapter xi	1499.1800
so much the better to that exclamation of porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door	677.1196
be it understood we are speaking of athos	494.3920
i believe i see double	835.4074
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world	507.3663
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments notice	1137.8755
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors answer	854.8247
he not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or not	2360.8716
you will find me ready to follow you they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin dartagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens	539.2314
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him	391.5286
it was delightful weather	1410.8659
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here	617.1857
then the postscript well what of the postscript then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter certainly the abb busoni and myself have a small account open between us	476.2948
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves	865.0314
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes mercds let them fall and sighed	1689.5477
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips	2219.0957
have you seen alas did you recognize valentine groaned	1867.0822
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of <unk>	941.5366
not even me asked the count with deep emotion	577.4085
come said the captain we have done all in our power and m morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves	409.6897
give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it the steward bowed and was about to quit the room	387.5392
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a <unk> the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi to be his guide	827.2049
nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind	508.5490
you seek me sir said he	417.7609
dants asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however <unk> was still a change and would afford him some amusement	839.0355
so you are not a mazarinist	395.2944
my friend said he here is a proof of it <unk> albert opened the paper it was an <unk> of four <unk> inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	885.0461
but you continued m bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days	779.6837
yes my prince but listen	883.6470
what do you want screamed milady	1327.2229
all london was crowding to the doors of the house	552.6648
go on aramis go on all at once a tall dark <unk> like yours dartagnan the same perhaps said he	900.6384
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched 2000 francs then these 1000 francs said mercds shuddering	1195.2693
yours is a pretty business but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between <unk> an infernal plan i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i <unk> her i curse her bah said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere	453.3195
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune	598.5643
we will go on gentlemen said the queen	318.3797
all at once he started	727.6085
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	582.1459
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible	1449.2990
one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges	395.1397
in whom can i trust place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger but i must write oh yes that is indispensable	446.4228
valentine looked at m davrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room	708.6807
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through	593.8783
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of <unk> which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth	531.9402
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest	547.9465
i cannot answer for the queen	508.8935
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	759.9155
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners	1102.8368
oh mon dieu	495.4350
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut i wish we were already there said dartagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the morning	484.8573
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from <unk> was unrolled in his mind	306.2705
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats all	561.0504
shall we wait or shall we charge let us charge them answered the gascon	1006.6837
and that you should fail me dartagnan passed a very bad night	582.7164
it would be long indeed ere you would find so <unk> a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill	744.7642
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their <unk> forward and one at the <unk> resumed the conversation	511.3715
for added he the future cannot fail to <unk> i inevitably look for better times	1107.0643
if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	1216.1965
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on franz who had nothing to conceal	408.3289
and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged do you think so i am sure of it then i would kill him rather than let him go and you would act rightly	408.3297
<unk> could not to me to a brother said felton	220.0849
franz found himself in utter darkness	1510.3915
dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	497.7065
just so	286.5175
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable	938.5297
stop a moment cried dartagnan pray how many men have you on board captain i dont understand was the reply	593.8118
well he shall live mercds uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect <unk> more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and <unk>	1036.2336
you receive 1500 francs per annum for your services <unk> than many a brave <unk> who continually risks his life for his country <unk>	543.2124
chapter lviii	55.7107
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single <unk> of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever <unk> and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a <unk> king	771.3291
the kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and <unk> the welfare of the kingdom	1089.2757
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together	1572.4514
will you go up with me i follow you monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories	639.6949
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m noirtier he then returned to his place but did not sit down	885.6553
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer yes much said dartagnan who did not well know how to answer	709.0552
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat	594.0797
madame de villefort remained <unk> in thought	921.6747
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner	594.7645
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	720.7101
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich and to have ideas added madame danglars	573.5958
at st omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed again	1808.1571
does anyone dare to slander me monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always <unk> the lady more than the gentleman enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment	846.8206
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained <unk> like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the <unk>	1756.6967
living my best friends would avoid my house dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home	823.6440
much monsieur mordaunt would care	1523.1953
i have the price and dartagnan threw the bag upon the table	414.8344
i confess it but pardon to every sin	2396.3557
now this was a sunday and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	394.1862
yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own well and what may you have to say against this name inquired albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess franz said no more	365.5385
i have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it hush said dartagnan the some one is coming the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	428.2733
let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief	1236.4662
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity	536.9484
the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light	1047.3162
dants must be crushed to gratify villeforts ambition	1219.0334
i guess what brings you here how and why because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject by whom by a banker of paris my correspondent whose name is danglars he cried albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred	836.7458
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not	483.0621
and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant	599.6208
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh	483.3944
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done mordaunt bowed humbly	418.8138
he was alone again	519.6072
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercds had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dants	1079.1219
queen	78.1257
what exclaimed porthos mutton again my dear monsieur de comminges said dartagnan you will find that my friend monsieur du vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat mutton every day i declare said porthos i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away remove the mutton cried comminges i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite is mazarin dead asked porthos	739.2592
you have not forgotten st gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by <unk> and ariosto	1211.4336
nevertheless at eight oclock in the morning the regiment of the queens guards commanded by guitant under whom was his nephew comminges marched publicly preceded by <unk> and trumpets <unk> off from the palais royal as far as notre dame a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms	618.1962
comminges saw that he was undecided	651.6766
i have devoted myself to industry i study the useful arts	2028.1427
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared	1401.9633
andrea read in a low voice you are poor a miserable old age awaits you	789.3597
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman the sailor departed without reply	795.5511
but dants cannot remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe <unk> him who was the cause of his <unk> oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me yes and mercds	478.8261
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss	957.8866
i have given the signal for what for the barricades	430.9916
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i cannot break	299.6282
a step a gesture a word on your part <unk> an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon	909.3637
then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going	1417.5989
he opened the door quickly and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild	756.3663
then m de trville made a sign with his hand and all retired except dartagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place	496.1902
de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champs lyses with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing room	464.3818
which i received this morning dartagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it	400.4619
to old times he said	427.8269
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half	489.0391
this clever person is your relative then cousin german go on to your cousin then aramis continued my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the <unk> rebellion of la rochelle	1395.3772
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave dartagnan uneasiness	1070.3856
they search her she <unk> they use <unk> scoundrels in spite of his prudence dartagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below	190.7908
your excellency has not stated the number of guests ah true how many covers count for yourself is everyone here your excellency yes bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	1445.8181
m noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	494.5006
no said morrel i am not mistaken	443.9986
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man	816.5551
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat	1733.2998
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed	2067.3250
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared	2244.6873
fire	34.0887
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgres which was likewise the way to paris	702.2228
i go to the louvre i ask for mme	370.9128
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is bertuccio bowed	524.8000
no monsieur le comte answered the servant i think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes	489.1996
to saddle	1191.4616
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain	1516.7629
grimaud in fact was not only the <unk> but the <unk> of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use	510.6263
a delicious <unk> played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea	59.9813
they found him up less pale than when dartagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons	611.3741
have you seen anything they asked	613.3869
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his <unk> noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke	301.1570
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on	441.0285
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you	569.9725
dartagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	747.1178
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of dartagnan	532.6672
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa	802.4349
yes you	64.5152
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am dartagnan dont you know me	441.8747
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court	576.8510
m de monte cristo yields his right of using his we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion	542.2920
he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed	755.4288
poor athos said he he will never guess what all this means	500.3199
you look like four conspirators oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning	833.3000
tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter	922.8410
where are you running to exclaimed a voice	379.9011
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death	346.4463
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess	488.4031
there was no further question therefore about marie michon among the four musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw mme	1100.5762
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	706.7029
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said dartagnan if you persist in offering him a civility	419.8374
did you drink some too m noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	1084.2855
<unk> no he wished to speak to your excellency i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed give it me said andrea and he read by the light of his carriage lamp you know where i live i expect you tomorrow morning at nine oclock andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect	483.0497
m dessessart who esteemed dartagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment	100.9954
anne of austria at the age of forty six	554.2176
strength and sagacity	1635.4900
you are the child of my captivity	343.5495

madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	1023.7583

athos and aramis followed him	338.8354
how so returned the count with surprise	401.6853
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	381.8995
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast <unk> of people	1721.0590
the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dants declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his beds head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself	2114.5698

but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of dartagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer	383.1797
shut the dungeon as if he were <unk> is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude <unk> silence of death which was all <unk> and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dants	848.0632

dartagnan determined upon his course	1271.6031

but as i cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance	838.5596
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	650.8176
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dants hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was	1045.4546
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled	586.7112

there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	552.2554
planchet repeated aramis and porthos	538.0844
oh he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans	1073.9454
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang	1169.5239
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant	525.9225

he cannot make me forget what i shall have lost thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on	878.6525
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion	490.5556
the stranger whom as yet dants knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a <unk> climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dants and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	783.3510

now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the <unk> for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and <unk> cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs	894.0188
this box contained an <unk> substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box	1903.4902

such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions	701.0735
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry	727.8549
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had <unk> himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room	1558.4048
the procurators wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and <unk> who cast bags of money at his feet	409.0912
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied davrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs study	1739.6798

because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth	883.9040
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors	494.9498

porthos placed his hand on the pistols	411.5036
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot	786.2269
how old is she inquired the vicomte de bragelonne	1038.6294

when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master	360.8504
its a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved	1015.2253
i felt some degree of <unk> as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said	977.0778

yes sir replied the abb and you are the person whom m de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police exactly sir one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	894.8492
that reply led to several questions about the kings capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the <unk> had any suspicions they vanished completely	1570.2920
you had only read a line or two said dartagnan read the letter again from the commencement willingly said aramis	615.6522
can it be bad news i fear it i will leave you with this stranger but as soon as he is gone if you will permit me i will return permit you	388.1902
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity	1593.3276
this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool	959.5717
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror <unk> in every direction	938.7195
albert was punctual	1432.1739

what do you demand that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	2165.5051
as to dartagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying	1034.5234
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck	717.6008

he had <unk> the wound and the man was better	736.8460
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah	884.4041

oh father father murmured she courage the pharaon has gone down then said morrel in a hoarse voice	847.0480
come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	1732.7634
he seated himself at his desk and dartagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter	610.5074
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in peace i doubt that replied dartagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	352.6056
i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds i have <unk> the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away	2079.6235

you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dants what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars	470.8578
1f	63.8380
this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels	845.0353
do you understand me he said	186.4520
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said but no it is not for me to be the judith to deliver <unk> from this <unk>	601.0618
he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside	1116.3007
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost	733.1936
i would lay a wager he has stolen it do you think so answered dartagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity	666.4868
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace	786.6367

had dants found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale	1004.2415

the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard	1552.4261
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment	2385.8081
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning	1051.3470

everywhere were swords pistols <unk> and <unk> and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty <unk> to the enemies of the parliament to unravel	2034.0282

still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance	534.2601
vampa then rushed towards teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed	819.2711
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move	1038.1541

sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity	1702.7219

farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st jean where state criminals were buried	1390.0546
this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance	904.9177

she what she asked dartagnan	384.7999
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	817.1849
dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently <unk> with an astonishment mingled with admiration	86.6275

he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure	1591.0417
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again	468.6591

look closely the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy <unk> began to form at the bottom of the cup this <unk> first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald	882.7689
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare	720.7612

monsieur baptistin especially i could never get such a man as that	653.5447
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward <unk>	143.4008

the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean	1343.0491

now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest	1555.7913
but you my dear dartagnan what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said dartagnan	519.1052
aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly	687.4958
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story	542.9258
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer	927.9897
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very <unk> and music of the <unk> <unk> you speak charmingly said porthos	148.8042
but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor the young man is better said danglars	1113.8845
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart	972.5184
the husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible animals which you are taking back to him said dartagnan	799.4055
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	1296.0552
to the swords	483.3442
the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge	825.7294
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	1037.7101
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height	1072.3925
chapter l the interview	1170.4858
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe	342.1011
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession	1584.0145
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality can he be seen without doing so	1763.1207
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	840.8314
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos how many have we killed of <unk> dozen or fifteen how many did we crush under the wall eight or ten and in exchange for all that not even a scratch	1418.5320
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and <unk> himself for my death be easy said dartagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead	892.1897
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged	454.0771
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the rue la <unk>	1536.3440
he opened the window a bright yellow <unk> crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon	1643.8857
aramis suffering at once in body and mind had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him that is to say the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder	672.1127
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant	500.6817
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	733.0681
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de <unk> hey pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively	936.3439
athos filled a <unk> with champagne and gave it to him	1513.4908
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts pistol	1151.4602
the regiments the <unk> and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct	2365.7195
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	523.4017
fortunately dants had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth	644.5403
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is <unk> well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	1128.2654
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions	735.9850
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans	442.5140
the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles	1085.4608
he told <unk> me <unk> was it	376.2475
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet thats it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had even to his horse monsieur for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was <unk> monsieur porthoss horse as well as his masters	710.2023
porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal <unk> which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing pierrefonds and added that name to his others	981.7827
as regarded her <unk> the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too <unk> and masculine for so young a person	1070.2494
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	2376.3289
i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her sons arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs	335.9348
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent	284.1661
sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as i can myself	772.4495
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion	949.9144
and do you know whither he went no not precisely however i think it was something very like a rendezvous diavolo said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late is it not countess these words were addressed to the countess g who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia the dukes brother	688.8149
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital faubourg saint germain said chteau renaud	2351.9265
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you cannot so make the best of it	397.2930
do you say resumed dartagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman i tell you i am sure of it continued the host	477.6615
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtiers lips seemed to start from his eyes	745.7553
edmond was intensely interested	982.3915
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me how did the viscount albert fall into luigis hands excellency the frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa the chiefs mistress yes	937.2968
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions	438.0490
i faint	1591.1473
we will wait for these gentlemen so please you i have plenty of time and it will be more correct	528.3995
ah	30.3146
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open	452.2588
and one of our <unk> has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your <unk> said milady oh my god	1294.0420
but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated to <unk> morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose to do what	776.7699
he was too late milady had stabbed herself	1820.3315
she must have a long arm hush said porthos placing a finger on his lips	753.7758
my dear porthos	766.4379
coquenard the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres	626.9618
provincial diffidence that slight <unk> the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had <unk> to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend	1244.3590
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you	361.0184
i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye	842.9740
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length	644.8228
for three months i watched m de villefort for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him	652.9429
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz dpinay	628.3013
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the alles de meilhan at marseilles	440.5974
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria	844.0811
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the <unk> who in turn looked at villefort	301.6790
the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help	587.8333
moreover you are our prisoners fool cried aramis knowest thou not then mordaunt	1626.7773
dartagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond	923.2552
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money	555.3871
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have	1220.8239
indeed thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry <unk> the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousins place i would not keep such <unk>	1512.6877
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in laws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance	768.2403
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin	201.4232
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought	409.3987
but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down	444.8272
and according to his custom dartagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him	876.5638
<unk> mon dieu cried danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me	935.4308
eleven oclock sounded	1471.4615
<unk> chapter 23 the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dants was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion	839.8525
you will restore them to her majesty and as a last <unk> looked round for some valuable <unk> will add he still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade	1169.2054
all this savors of his eminence a league off but what is to be done said dartagnan	432.8712
planchet turned and returned the billet	625.2424
i forgot said athos laughing	2356.7729
remember raoul this	645.8909
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans eyes	791.9291
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you	414.7540
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this <unk> of power would be overthrown	759.7924
i claim then the right to choose my opponent	1258.6200
porthos alone made no reply	1094.8191
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain	714.0812
i thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs	702.6063
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the <unk> article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf	205.1088
allow me then sire to intercede for her with your majesty let her humble herself then and come to me first on the contrary sire set the example	558.1836
the world is not wanting in attractions	1914.1342
there was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria	595.9355
well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied dartagnan	776.5577
csar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncles papers there is a will they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless	1302.3698
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of r and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm	674.1940
mercds drew near and plucked the fruit	1845.4734
she will soon pass she is already late	1050.0590
the sailors looked at one another	1088.4655
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror	612.9819
on entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m andrea cavalcanti	1564.2812
he had learned that dants had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dants was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to <unk> the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	255.6572
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be <unk> pretty good when i havent eaten for twenty four hours muttered danglars	478.7063
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole good	1314.8928
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her	510.3737
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to <unk> the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted <unk> and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet	1264.2633
like the ancient <unk> he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love	1415.8550
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could	598.8253
valentine said he dear valentine you must not speak <unk> let me die	1122.0798
she undertook his seduction and succeeded she would have seduced a saint	1517.8524
eh monsieur eh friend said dartagnan a half pistole for that paper my faith monsieur with great pleasure	866.9686
you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions	126.1759
it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander he dismounted and entered	732.2038
bonacieux we shall hear no more on the contrary said dartagnan we shall hear better dartagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to mme	498.4085
chapter 27 the story first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise what is that inquired the abb	604.2655
after some hours of repose the <unk> were aroused by athos	2132.8372
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their <unk> <unk> in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant <unk> rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and <unk> the light that gilded its massive <unk> so that the voyagers were in shadow	1981.0068
they employ him because they are afraid of him	742.7307
chapter xlvi	572.6883
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn dartagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye	602.0299
there is but little reason why i should delay you	549.3752
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly <unk> to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you i shall take better care of them myself answered dartagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape	1300.1428
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as dartagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris	626.2620
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards	613.4708
he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired	1500.1404
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m noirtiers room	467.2667
what a noise about a musketeer	612.3115
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france	549.1463
bicarat and porthos had just made <unk>	2405.6326
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late you see said athos pointing to mme	729.5934
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort	1231.7820
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers throat	2343.0911
but oh how i passed that time	434.5663
what do you want	439.1396
aramis whom we have sent for thats true said athos we must wait for aramis at that moment aramis entered	560.0699
although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him i will obey your orders my lord good bye until saturday when i may expect you may i not yes i promised you the count watched albert waving his hand to him	247.8246
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life dartagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous	713.2094
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	1907.1252
but putting his head out of the carriage eh	667.5654
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick	1117.3882
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a <unk> extinct volcano before the days when <unk> and <unk> had deserted <unk> to come and found the city of rome	1144.5470
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning	592.6061
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated they continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service	628.4526
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them <unk> were the <unk> which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely	2284.8616
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello	496.3366
have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the <unk> sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his <unk> and the register of his voyagers	787.7039
i saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me thats all but since you believe i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may and danglars rose as if he meant to depart	697.7635
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her	355.2350
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy	1690.9849
he also drank half a glass of this <unk> served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible <unk> terror of all expert <unk>	1000.8054
adieu then till we meet again said valentine tearing herself away	1752.3037
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick	618.7023
chapter iii	849.3902
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage i do not think that is the case however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed	366.7722
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor	2262.1868
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded	640.8826
take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing room said the viscount they make the countess ill the footman obeyed his orders	1230.2076
he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs get as near to him as you can and cut off two	845.0087
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are <unk> to figures like an algebraic <unk> but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree <unk> well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two <unk> the second day and so on	1122.8527
ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saint mrans death	306.6744
now as they had already traveled eleven leagues dartagnan thought it time to stop whether porthos were or were not in the inn	833.0037
but mio caro did not reply	1386.1308
but were you not on horseback	399.1933
it wants ten minutes to nine said he	1057.1351
he is moving and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see	488.4716
be satisfied beautiful constance	1146.5859
they directed their horses to the city	685.5716
just so replied aramis	478.5146
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws	1304.9066
because he had no cash to save	613.1409
as to that no replied athos laughing	431.8659
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh tis a noble <unk> athos yes true as gospel said dartagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities i remember well said planchet he was fond of <unk> truth he drank but not as other men drink	657.7045
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle	851.0444
far from here asked athos	503.7222
curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramiss room	832.2314
we have fallen in with a party of spaniards	603.8974
in the midst of one of these <unk> i heard the door open	691.5231
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	580.4753
two or three times a week	846.7234
the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice	537.0936
for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time ma foi i should like to smoke monte cristo took the gong and struck it once	1568.4026
do you know them fernand he said	344.1476
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands	419.1693
thank you la ramee said the prisoner	447.6984
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	338.9624
my dear bazin said dartagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger	867.7883
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate	464.2009
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse	1889.1168
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have	1220.8239
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	582.4130
but they are calling me	743.6503
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you be it so then replied athos sorrowfully	590.1335
ah	90.6699
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	483.6273
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around	643.0352
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	2322.6531
very well come this way dartagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	730.3793
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly	1029.0726
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless	1530.7692
come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend	1056.9280
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars	633.7439
hold	42.0241
to be sure for monsieur de wardes now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur dartagnan go to bed mademoiselle said milady i dont like comments dartagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in	604.2177
everything was conducted in the usual manner	433.3064

and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the <unk> who received him with great coldness	673.9905
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated	1816.8109

under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	1042.7830
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction	1318.6049
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude	727.5003
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace	1224.0146
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	1226.3326
alas what would become of me who can only <unk> for evil by doing good <unk> then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul morrel smiled sadly	1910.5923
a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich	844.5865
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	890.8388
but make hastei cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dants ears the bed creaked and the heavy <unk> of a man who <unk> a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	1403.6194
you particularly wish it asked he	712.1699
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman	905.7148
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment	1677.8687
monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife	772.4377
why you see he did not expect to see dants return so <unk> thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless	1263.7515
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly	376.3378
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a <unk> on board the vessel about to sail	552.3808
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	700.2864
i cannot throw the <unk> through this partition nor move with a pack thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds no but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit	1032.9900
i have only one thing to say to you	213.4584
but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits i have a dreadful <unk> said albert	1014.8492
yes <unk> that is to say highway robbers at them cried raoul	1304.7886
i live as it were between two graves	1154.8198
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none	642.3361
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart	2237.1946
chapter xviii	342.3145
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage	1757.8062
stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by jupiter	2455.5291
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to <unk> from the usual etiquette of duels	640.3883
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements <unk> my <unk> will know who my father is said the obstinate youth i will perish if i must but i will know it	635.5366
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	978.8634
you promise to become one of the lights of the church	353.0570
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm	729.6783
fear that <unk> <unk> clogged dants efforts	666.1935
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winters neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereigns confidence and friendship	618.1579
the rabbit died	1015.2956
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes	2238.2146
it is my happiness my treasure my hope	867.9452
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried <unk>	332.0706
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four <unk> together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right <unk> in <unk> a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it <unk> us to find it there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its <unk> and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	472.3116
this idea completely restored clemency to his heart	1077.6045
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not he is really out sir replied baptistin	613.6873
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person yes but in our situation we must not say all we <unk> as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues well can i see porthos certainly monsieur	544.3277
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter dartagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes	239.6340
ah	62.0431
edmond welcomed the meeting with this <unk> had been one of his own <unk> a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance	1900.7195
at this last thought mercds burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dants incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to us the old man died as i have told you had he lived mercds perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity	1075.7394
bah cried porthos	657.4106
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of <unk> which would crush us but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors bah	588.3801
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking nevertheless or find some one else continued dartagnan turning his back	475.8059
some of your people have committed the strangest <unk> have just arrested edmond dants mate of my vessel i know it monsieur replied villefort and i am now going to examine him oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do	2113.4216
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz	1300.9354
wrapped in this sweet idea dartagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings <unk> the elegance of the rest of the apartment	913.8170
everything is ready is it not yes the cargo on board yes five full casks and fifty empty ones good we are carrying port wine to <unk> excellent	1054.7706
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself	1217.1730
en route gentlemen and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris	1211.2927
it was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	332.0015
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	395.1096
ha	64.6173
that was not the appointed hour	345.8244
chapter xlvii	1080.9187
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume	1115.1542
see answered the voice	355.7131
section 1 general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic works 1a	248.5134
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least what is that did you observe dartagnan that three days running they have brought us <unk> mutton no but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles forget them for a time we shall return to them unless mazarin <unk> them to the ground do you think that likely no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it you reconcile me dartagnan well then assume a cheerful manner as i do we must joke with the guards we must gain the good will of the soldiers since we cant corrupt them	839.1808
he sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over	562.6646
dants you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers eyes	524.2267
he will come in here and m morrel had better godo you not think so grandpapa yes signed the old man	1558.0884
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached <unk> which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	920.7593
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger	496.7751
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	1074.7616
but first let hayde be informed that i have returned here i am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely	340.6262
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression	727.8025
i wont have him killedi wont	1436.7994
dartagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds	1385.6497
dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	438.3036
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	863.4642
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwells tent dartagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle	572.8984
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porters lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here his excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali	883.5568
pierced hearts said athos	963.2176
the child was small for his age and <unk> pale	1854.7798
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous <unk> of <unk> wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen	2380.4287
you are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear maximilian	452.9031
i do not say i regret no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven and the curate did the same	803.7848
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for all dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what <unk> right and left among the <unk> have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were <unk>	579.9811
you see said lord de winter presenting dartagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman	534.4601
she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course	947.0804
i depend on you	982.6365
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that to morrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him off he has said it and will do it tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not dartagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his <unk> entrance you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them now sire resumed aramis listen to me	503.3282
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble	1336.6538
we have undergone a great deal of fatigue remember and a little rest will do no harm i rest	1094.5361
by degrees the passage <unk> yet the duke continued his course	2234.5261
this door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector	649.8734
most likely said dartagnan i am one of his most faithful servants it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes a certain dartagnan a barnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london do you know him personally asked the governor	471.4815
then it will <unk> on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can	652.9647
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous <unk> forgiveness she was purchasing with her death	1046.1592
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own	989.6830
it was just in time for valentines head swam and she staggered madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event	1110.1331
as to that we know dartagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle	750.0859
athos and dartagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	854.4604
so call me mercds if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dants he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m dants said danglars bowing to the young couple	1014.3378
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him	346.6742
ah	62.5395
the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs	1241.3618
the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head	1233.0460
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose <unk> glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence	912.6412
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the <unk> did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success	786.6747
what men call the chances of <unk> ruin change <unk> have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me	451.4644
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m coquenard had ascended	762.6399
at last he sank	1461.0645
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted but as she was only a procurators wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you dont offer me any holy water porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years	492.9217
<unk> the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing	459.5815
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars	290.8668
i beg your excellencys pardon interposed the steward in a <unk> manner for venturing to observe that it is already two oclock i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly	1811.0010
whom do i see yonder where in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a cloak it is he cried dartagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man	1093.8448
do you see that street	374.2284
at nine oclock the next morning the <unk> beat to arms	2278.7632
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of <unk> considerably to their credit	491.5941
meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so <unk> alas resistance was far from my thoughts	1142.1934
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	1222.1956
ah this time cried dartagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment	462.4551
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dants knew that he had escaped the first peril	886.7552
stop cried dartagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men	1122.9433
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place	952.7287
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and <unk> is a living corpse	653.8486
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her	1275.7115
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted	1302.8536
de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely <unk> their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his <unk> regiment	621.5733
who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m	463.8734
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a <unk>	1764.4193
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the <unk> one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in <unk> of importance yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh	1643.3090
the valet re entered	569.8052
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villeforts brow	903.6204
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready	893.5440
<unk> thou there cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears	882.4478
here is madame returning with monsieur dartagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who <unk> in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos	698.1292
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made dants shudder	1309.5155
yes but he has been avenged	923.4718
a black satin stock fresh from the <unk> hands gray moustaches a bold eye a majors uniform ornamented with three medals and five <unk> fact the thorough bearing of an old <unk> was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted	748.9266
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man	589.3902
you are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder	1458.3013
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees <unk> on a stormy sky invaded by large <unk> clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night	2354.4727
besides dartagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his <unk> habits	1523.0028
yes	78.5655
dartagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised	1053.7703
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp	627.1023
dartagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	806.5748
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him davrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	728.2521
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	2230.2148
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	798.6097
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced	1015.9183
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking <unk> at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another	854.0685
it is certainly the king said the man rising again	386.0806
i do not madame rejoined mazarin	1093.4198
pardieu resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman	832.3982
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it <unk> according to his custom	452.5517
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been <unk> was only not precisely loved	1946.5974
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it	699.9979
what is your name my friend she said	295.7427
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you dants took the hand of the abb in his and affectionately pressed it	311.3521
the two girls looked with horror upon this shameful <unk> the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave	1746.7408
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am <unk> have already said <unk> as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself	644.4337
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	1491.9878
then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	1038.1664
now my lord said the poor man let me have the <unk> <unk>	1641.6633
oh what <unk> meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning	1604.0663
i advise you to complain said porthos	655.0079
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton	994.5827
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian	589.3604
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god i will go said the monk	664.6419
humph murmured athos it is certainly she and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady	922.2836
monsieur du tremblay received dartagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	864.7543
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said athos	836.3405
bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend	495.4792
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah	394.1826
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	1316.2062
come along athos come along cried dartagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his	1478.5732
now since dartagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way	624.3719
this is one of those attempts that happen every day are you sure that we are not its objects we	579.5803
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner	920.9169
the young man was overwhelmed as he read	512.6144
you insist on my <unk> the article relating to general fernand an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do yes i insist on it said albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings	1552.9325
and you obeyed father that woman was a monster	676.1462
what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell	750.5793
oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame	1672.3173
edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story	478.3180
who prepared it the chemist who came here with me <unk> drink it said the doctor to barrois	1162.5050
many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial	1711.6896
but it is beginning again i say well said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at maximilian let it begin <unk> is like the house of the <unk> god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment	461.8808
partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution	899.1388
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs	2100.6328
1c	43.0779
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	486.6447
oh no	442.5963
it is war said the prince	335.0293
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	498.5640
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment	1102.6737
at his house rebellion could be <unk> with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queens invalid as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes	1034.2650
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthoss opinion is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	654.6401
on perceiving the count he rose quickly	872.9691
that little stratagem may serve to keep off <unk> very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven oclock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	2022.4594
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed	527.4195

it was precisely at this moment that m de trville on leaving the residence of the lieutenant criminel and the governor of fort levque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace	482.7303
calm and dignified said he	457.9039
well said aramis beaten by fate beaten said athos	1612.2185

the queen had confidence in the courage of dartagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced	243.2590
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price	653.8284

albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult	1611.3047
a folded paper fell from edwards breast	706.5132

then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips	568.3005
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress	979.2892
and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued dartagnan	898.5901

their joy was great	719.1360

why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	418.9504
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini	369.4543

lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her	897.2274

by its light between the island of lemaire and cape <unk> a quarter of a league distant dants saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves	1786.7599

at the <unk> off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned back	1110.5842

perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemys army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle	1037.6814
grimaud rose	101.6760
then he stepped into his coup calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes	839.4794
m bonacieux who was ignorant that dartagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinals executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the <unk> the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture	588.9399
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian	663.1696
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal	793.9364

on leaving the chamber danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry re entered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs lyses no	1132.7568

you see i am calm and strong	626.8820
impious task cried milady with the exultation of a victim who <unk> his judge	1805.5532
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time	837.6696
he was in a most elegant hunting costume and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him	727.7012
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife <unk> open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	978.3231
my poor friend resumed dartagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead ifaith said rochefort theres no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive now i have been buried alive or very nearly so and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile do you wish me to speak the truth yes well then i dont know have you any suspicion of me rochefort no	924.3696

in the rue de seine he met planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing appearance	784.3662
they were only fit for a young man i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horses and i do not think they were dear	710.5444
come on come on said dartagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my half pistole	646.1053
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers energy what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours <unk> does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are	1214.3381
but peppino did not answer	1606.8461
where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance	333.0739
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m	763.7717
the count does not know how should i know	528.0204
that door is guarded dartagnan you know that very well you will force it said porthos	380.1720
i have chosen a trade a trade	2150.5217

you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple	1775.9587
one <unk> was the morning of the day my story <unk> king louis xiv then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame	2137.5991
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dants that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to <unk> us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose <unk> nature received and betrayed each fresh impression	139.0220
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution	1919.5167
diable a pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with anxiety	924.6165
it appeared to me such women as i never weep said milady	591.7709
do not speak so loud young <unk> speak so loud	777.2479
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much planchet shook his head and said nothing	618.2578
you know or you dont know that that is what we ask of you oh	285.0440
for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared	722.4918
the marquis de saint mran i think the concierge said	1065.1516
gondy smiled the queens color rose and mazarin grew even paler	2489.1377
do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation on a level with the floor how is it concealed behind my bed has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner no what does your chamber open on a corridor and the corridor on a court alas murmured the voice	857.3655
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts daughter	831.5020
danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man <unk> armed with guns continually passed	1098.2506
that happened as i told you in 1829 for gods sake tell me did you know this englishman but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service yes then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of <unk> the obligation everything is possible in this affair even a miracle what was his name asked monte cristo	703.8044
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	443.5925
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house then you abandon me doctor yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold	863.8270
ive broken my mans skull cried dartagnan	2451.6121
patience athos	433.5552
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	1210.8364
no madame i will not thus waste your time	772.9609
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs then sell <unk> out marquis or you will lose it all <unk> but how can i sell out here you have a <unk> have you not yes then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his <unk> ordering him to sell out at the market price	1075.5941
the price of his blood she murmured	840.2246
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar	382.7868
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a <unk> line	1603.5953
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the htel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	691.3487
bonacieux i say that i have reflected i renew the affair i obtain the letter and i run directly to the cardinal well go quickly	418.9393
you shall see and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor broussel is being arrested	595.6295
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened	843.7300
two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after her	266.4862
what says monsieur the abb	821.8927
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is <unk> is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your <unk> and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank	346.6872
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you cant refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea	1405.9532
yet thither it was that dants guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a first class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hours	412.7312
in fact her position was terrible	1220.3751
crushed and impoverished by <unk> by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to <unk> them down to the very <unk> people as the advocate general <unk> described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by <unk> they began to murmur	1584.9718
it is he cried dartagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he	309.5551
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence	2093.8806
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth	703.2941
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come	516.2798
give me anything you like it is of little consequence go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints	543.7342
sir monk said de guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder	898.9141
about seven oclock in the morning they set out	585.6393
give me your horse porthos	476.2887
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance	1491.4729
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before <unk> letters of unlimited credit	498.3603
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	974.1335
ah	23.7698
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity	633.1781
ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she	638.3685
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard	1110.7410
yes if it isnt contrary to the rules oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling	565.4512
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance	734.5755
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abb we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dants	780.0801
they understood then from the few words which escaped from dartagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him dartagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way	448.9788
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth athos may always be found replied trville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him	929.5181
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than <unk>	1689.0153
why to converse with him of course	558.3412
are there then really women who bear the name of hayde anywhere but in byrons poems certainly there are	2251.2827
another person was confined in the chteau at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest ah <unk> repeated monte cristo and what was his mania he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firmament	326.7228
one can say anything to me	442.3853
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of <unk> saw a blue sea and an azure sky	583.9653
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of <unk> cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit	2252.7217
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	333.4923
i go to morrow my friend replied dartagnan	459.3965
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion	1245.7219
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an <unk> pan containing <unk> peas <unk> with bacon	1133.1534
i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misfortune i attach myself to it	1078.4286
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will	400.0231
then dants rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	2168.1565
what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is right cried the marquise	680.8916
what is it said dartagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance	652.6111
i	54.9990
i know all these things	905.8304
oh bid him enter and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold	1482.1366
now the <unk> says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord that is true said his <unk>	599.4853

all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrinis the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting	1313.3313
i did not even draw my sword but i took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window	545.8066
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground pistache my friend jump for the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de <unk> the dog turned his back to the cane	721.8654
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the <unk> gigantic bellows the monstrous <unk> the superhuman fans	980.0581
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	563.1847
that is all very simple you had business in england monseigneur said dartagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or <unk> concerns nobody	1166.4124
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase	572.0705
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others <unk> them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults	1010.5034
oh by the way <unk> better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui <unk>	1481.6276
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory	1566.6527
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner have you a spanish prisoner cried the prince	1522.0815
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me	532.2922
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abb on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died	580.8485
what do you propose zounds	185.0419

chapter li	1527.7568
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them	495.3297

handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow	393.4240
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes	1003.8556
your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits what cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered <unk> not make any resistance no for it would be useless	1216.0638
dartagnan alone had discovered <unk> ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him	901.0796
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home stop a moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my companions	658.0806
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire	1862.2106
let us break the carriage cried the people	508.5745
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	553.5093
chapter <unk>	192.6762

he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food	1334.6919
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs lyses	590.2361
they are not dead for the death of dartagnan would make a sensation	360.1061
never never added porthos	1615.1617
on the entrance of the new comers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began <unk>	916.3583
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme	694.8797
i learn this desire or rather i suspect that you feel it and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing i send one of my officers to meet you i place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which i am governor whither i come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other i have prepared you a chamber	444.7440

we are not such devils as we appear to be	535.5589
the <unk> of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory	1638.5406
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your <unk> and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her <unk> i now do at your entreaty	1138.0453
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out	453.3307
what is his name count albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome in what language would you like me to converse with him monte cristo turned to albert	426.3083
dartagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	1130.8464
the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the <unk> that m dartagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m dartagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings whereas mme	925.2936
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	708.1669
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	139.4419
in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years <unk> and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen	776.1602
that it seems is where he <unk> on state affairs in that case said dartagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort <unk> soldiers and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers the soldiers are swiss who understand only german	795.4435
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said dartagnan	663.9340

they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him	1403.4420
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw dartagnan who stood expecting her	1293.2728
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	253.1599
now mousqueton he said i hope you dont mean to desert your master ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army	886.7608
so dartagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from <unk> and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply	640.5344
at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the <unk> of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour	732.9017

ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all	459.3482
he thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor	401.3138
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	1675.0452
the two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone	612.5290

28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order	339.6978
is there any difficulty in the way no replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn the deuce	489.1820

monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abb busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities	453.4073

and you porthos i agree to it too said porthos if dartagnan approves of it	475.5083
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after them	667.1561
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that <unk> so well with the <unk> complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the <unk> of his look and the malice of his smile	971.5553
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of <unk> our friends and on my part said dartagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything	679.4646

for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge <unk> indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced	1576.1419
he looked at <unk> was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it	1349.6591
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly	1257.0137
the ballet of la <unk> on the morrow nothing was talked of in paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen and in which their majesties were to dance the famous la <unk> favorite ballet of the king	1006.9156
it was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	867.6216
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his gold mounted cane the papers that lay on the table	1427.1550
dants went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	473.4009
ah my friend said the abb turning towards dants and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in <unk> i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811 because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical <unk> i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my csar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me	743.8715
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dants formerly <unk> only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercds by the count	1235.3954
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m de trville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen	383.9960
friquet had put on his sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to <unk> by introducing a handful of cherry <unk> into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from bazin	744.7436
deuce take those italian princes a man too who could boast of dante for a <unk> and could reckon back to the <unk> <unk> a nobility of the rope said chteau renaud phlegmatically	2030.4158
my dear planchet said dartagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me	873.0478
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party	344.3837
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him	1220.3076
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they <unk> the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abb was aged and weak besides his mind was too <unk> to allow him to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count	1011.8124
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon perfected	865.3477
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword	259.6550
besides what is required of a young man in paris	289.6023
it depends on you only i listeni am waiting to hear sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston since i have had the honor of being my lords steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me	528.6218
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts	1266.0889
those in whom the king has <unk> <unk> highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the <unk> <unk> which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once	1616.4060
furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make mistakes	619.7697
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	1910.0229
you are strong among the strong mordaunt he said and the frenchmen how did they behave most fearlessly yes yes murmured cromwell the french fight well and if my glass was good and i mistake not they were foremost in the fight they were replied mordaunt	1040.2218
at the sixth cabaret then as we said dartagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and <unk> who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him	629.2998
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance	795.3763
the president looked at his auditors	1687.9622
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	857.5437
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy it drives me to despair said fernand	643.1664
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past	746.9197
this hole communicated with a kind of <unk> space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below it	1056.5128
the duchess was the first to speak	324.5355
by the orders of the deputy procureur i believe so the conviction that they came from m de villefort relieved all dants apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort	616.3869
a surgeon	704.2429
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses	521.7245
ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of <unk> in which i am not initiated	1189.2936
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo	1500.9125
or rather at what he said and what was he saying he said this madame mazarin is a stumbling block	468.2655
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest dartagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille go to	672.2874
he was carried home in the arms of the people	271.2044
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands yes yes madame you must and i will save them all but how	428.5691
toward the end of the service the queen seeing comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the louvre said in a whisper go comminges and may god aid you comminges immediately left the church and entered the rue saint christophe	480.0513
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dants repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	553.6494
dartagnan turned to porthos	322.3716
milady therefore continued coloring her <unk> more and more	1582.3485
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to you there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching	873.8404
athos examined it and became very pale	821.0001
come the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristos door	911.7144
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword the two gentlemen then went into the church	476.3528
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor <unk> that disorder in short which <unk> the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance	968.4900
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance dartagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athoss last remark he stopped short	481.2959
you have insulted a <unk> man	1457.9535
<unk> no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor	2017.1112
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once	970.8666
follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents <unk> is the form said he	859.5526
i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de <unk> appearance	389.5968
this as you know is the important point of distinction between the <unk> and the cavalier after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barber	880.2183
i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours	291.7074
one fine morning the king commanded m de chevalier dessessart to admit dartagnan as a cadet in his company of guards	922.3496
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	532.8438
i have told you that i was traveling on an important mission	597.5204
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there	693.0092
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them	1010.7654
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him	299.6390
chapter 92 the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian	1723.1036
but you my <unk> you not going to change your dress no i shall go as i am	633.5215
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself dartagnan reached notre dame	1702.6018
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation <unk> toward the cardinal	814.1061
i promised to come said felton and i have come you promised me something else what my god said the young man who in spite of his self command felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow	360.7178
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of yes it was i so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth condescend to listen to me and you shall know all i listen i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated <unk> of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers	339.6714
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos he can he says only swim in rivers when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere	1337.5898
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter	2158.1575
sir he said you are a profound <unk> and your plan was sublime say absurd since it has become useless	1391.3894
75 does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested it will be too late they will be gone but still we can make sure that they are so take ten men of my guardsmen and search the two houses thoroughly instantly monseigneur and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment	910.3594
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent	1366.0112
people die very suddenly in your house m de villefort what cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still <unk> on that terrible idea still sir and i shall always do so replied davrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m de villefort the magistrate trembled convulsively	621.5102
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features	410.1244
and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown	344.2929
these two men were the executioners assistants	2101.8540
why does not he go about his business stupid fellow yourself said dartagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window	811.7323
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances	725.7976
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he <unk> like a horse	1246.7013
it is kept by a friend of ours at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the peacock yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken <unk> aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	553.2968

at nine oclock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word	969.6082
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent death planchet said dartagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care	648.6279

the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive	1777.1422

he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping	952.4747

and that one if i mistake not a lamprey just so	708.7844
he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis	826.8077
you are not judges	1026.7767
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so	1218.6266
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited dartagnan to drink	1010.3510
well after all said dartagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such	599.1052
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying	816.6341

i feel if this continues said mme	1861.2500
but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of dartagnan had not entirely effaced	389.5059
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied dartagnan and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account	237.6777
coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious <unk> with her husband	1081.4224
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his <unk> powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	2365.1802
athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in	402.5785
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune	1462.2682
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there	354.4010
they expected to hear some mention made of dartagnan or of porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and <unk>	715.2242
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal	238.2236
oh he cried athos	285.4638
if only for the sake of m de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously m	760.6834
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects	1084.1196

my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern	877.0953
i was sure of itthe cursed letter dont be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure ah like the charming journey the other day when it <unk> bullets and produced a crop of steel traps well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed dartagnan i will go without you	1061.7500
chapter <unk>	1521.0822
so so replied porthos	442.2541
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord dartagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside	551.7990
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini	597.0635
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	817.1000
she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof	2275.2073
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the <unk> surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the <unk> at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two <unk> of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaa	1292.2876
now you talk my dear you pardon me we shall see said porthos majestically and the two separated saying till this evening the devil thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenards strongbox at last chapter xxxv	641.4528
felton give me that knife and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom	722.7987
i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought	893.2607
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every <unk> carnival holy week <unk> christi and the feast of st peter	508.7831
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	583.1625
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately	158.0426
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears	424.1989
it is there you are to take up your quarters then in these trunks i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to <unk> plain clothes and your uniform	764.3175
that mood lasted some time but now hes as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing and du vallon asked athos	2497.4255
prepare then for your departure and never despair of us	490.8794
oh m davrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same <unk> of moving or speaking and the same love for <unk> my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly	392.0440
killed him or <unk> him sir as is most agreeable to you i did not know that replied m de trville in a somewhat softened tone	554.9302
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned dartagnan	220.4094
chapter xv	414.0245
we did not see her monseigneur said athos	437.5894
but tell me what didnt he speak of me in any way ah	539.9517
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias	484.1349
chapter 114 peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente	1731.9828

i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous you are right madame and i will not finish but it was my husband who would not hear of <unk> madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory the procurators wife uttered a groan	703.0507
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path ah	692.9745
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	1160.1481
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	1346.7281
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning	739.5120
gentlemen i am young scarcely twenty three years old	900.8278
they reached the rue st honor and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades	940.2521
did edmond make you his heir no merely his <unk> <unk>	439.5774
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next <unk> peers you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs my friends will submit them	415.8452
the poor girl ventured a glance at dartagnan which said see how i suffer on your account toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of dartagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss	689.0074
halloo grimaud grimaud appeared	2264.3105
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him	432.4273
un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin it doesnt surprise me said dartagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no dont be alarmed but where did you get all these details from a good source sir i heard it from friquet from friquet	1219.3065
what	57.3665
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the <unk> of his <unk>	2081.1780
adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he <unk> cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed	1374.7499
jesus seigneur	911.7812
well	83.8762
faria smiled <unk> on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend	719.7358
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation i want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine rather say to take him back with you into the world	501.7105
when he had gone monte cristo breathed a profound sigh and said enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered i am going to madames <unk> the carriage ready at one oclock chapter 49 hayde it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel	832.3879
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion what exclaimed dartagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise <unk> men in short so great by merit or <unk> she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier anne understood this <unk> reproach and was more moved than irritated by it	426.9427
who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money	1853.8796
but said morrel the <unk> <unk> assassin do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said villefort	647.0720
an englishman you say yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome	692.9427
why did he kill himself instead of you	348.0750
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her	1071.0352
in the meantime my dear lucien here are <unk> of <unk> them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves peste i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable	2051.7212
i thought i did not mistake	664.5846
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champs lyses and my chteau at trport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dants upon the son of his old master morrel	582.9020
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard	325.6603
the three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put	781.2386
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its <unk> the tartan bore down within a quarter of a <unk> of him	2034.2407
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too	375.8715
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last	282.6170
you will also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of this country he bowed	718.6661
i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed oh	1707.7665
there were a thousand ingots of gold each <unk> from two to three pounds then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the <unk> of alexander vi	2127.8777

the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity	1532.8721
benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine <unk> in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn	1525.7511
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other	815.4753
zounds	28.2215
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered	560.2440
i cannot stay here any longer with all my heart replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable	980.8870
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in	434.1649
chapter 116 the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very <unk> of appetite	1679.8140
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us yes but the son has done us no harm grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands	359.5441
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a flambeau in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of <unk> compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven oclock talking of affairs of state	2492.2126
to be sure answered danglars	1117.7585

courage	66.3631
at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived he had seen chteau renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised	750.6806
read then	341.7638
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great	630.7926
what end would that answer	780.3234
dartagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen	1238.1335
are you ill sir i am very hungry replied mouston	1077.8008
cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said morrel	787.5296
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of braccianos but also return to florence alone if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least	509.5379
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an <unk>	2137.7488
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la <unk> can see nothing remarkable about it my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens	1077.3352
i should want a porter well leave them with your porter he is to be trusted	736.5839
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror	1418.1300
dartagnan lost no time in useless compliments	1313.7472
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter	582.3586
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing	446.5477
athos killed his adversary first	1456.1749
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing room m danglars at the other and eugnie in front of him	483.8106
i saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading him do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles yes	638.2236
me	70.3677
can you imagine said monte cristo some <unk> or abb de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall	1364.7188
you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here	327.8035
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant	830.7827
i want to learn everything said the abb	985.9802
he were a dead man said the gascon if there were still a vitry at the court and if vitry entered at this moment but for my part before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me hush said porthos listen madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what are you about then he added in spanish anne are you mad	549.3597
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	2034.8500
a shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a <unk> of a dozen years rising behind the third	2470.2112
i draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in paris at the end of this month	1582.2067
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only <unk> by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a <unk> of blood traced with a delicate brush	1436.9684
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said dartagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick dartagnan	1692.8582
why did you leave the closet monsieur dartagnan asked the cardinal	380.8282
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as dartagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him	515.0795
well picture to yourself a future more gloomy <unk> frightful perhaps sanguinary the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat	448.1694
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland	1546.7004
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	604.8357
the deuce cried dartagnan	1260.6664
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and <unk> at the bottom of my heart	744.0134
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing	819.5751
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar	684.0068
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	530.4800
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back	1063.0367
take care of the executioner dartagnan all right	421.3347
it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he	759.5511
it was scarcely eleven oclock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m de trville who could not fail to think the manner in which dartagnan had left him a little cavalier	685.4667
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de <unk> whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governors country house so it is said dartagnan i know him now	777.7473
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table	1100.0410
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know i have enemies replied dants my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	442.2138
you were recommended to monsieur de trville were you not yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that	570.6129
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	1863.0873
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone	991.3861
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the english regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance	426.1718
dartagnan and the englishman dartagnan followed milady without being perceived by her	551.8748
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	1137.7968
while the struggle between day and night lasted dants still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	1136.3301
you have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you	346.9579
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugnie received him with her accustomed coldness	1734.2323
then we shall pay the more thats all i see plainly enough	775.5190
the night was extremely dark	1255.7513
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting	697.1273
i was taken to versailles for three months i struggled with death at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south	826.1929
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	526.8525
then m morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dants on the subject	238.6288
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht	1425.7911
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet	1114.0455
monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin no matter said dartagnan in his most wheedling tone	1196.6785
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	452.8030
and will you not torment me any more never caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change	801.6845
this is the case said dartagnan this is your brother madeleine you dont know him perhaps but i know him he has arrived from amsterdam	379.6693
you are included in the conscription fernand and are only at liberty on <unk> liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms	1488.2036
my strength is failing me i am dying the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos	1252.8823
what was the matter with you baron dartagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal	307.9660
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded	609.9269
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dants pressing his hand to his throbbing brows	695.6795

ah you frighten me	1107.7937
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house	446.6725
in ten minutes dartagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt	193.1861

bonacieux	70.0180
how was he going to find athos	256.3988
he drew portraits with a piece of <unk> of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good <unk> he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	927.0287

<unk> when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name	738.1985
perhaps god will pardon you but i never for pitys sake said the executioner extending his arms	814.3939

a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white <unk> and a <unk> eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the <unk> and <unk> muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking	1788.3087
dants hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together	441.0735
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh	972.5982
this time you shall not escape me neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you in the name of the king i arrest you how	382.2528

the generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to <unk> the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went	508.6541
do you think it is worth while said villefort	458.0791
according to the laws of dueling at that period dartagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased	713.2366
surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abb it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself	354.1275
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold	1572.3893
dants heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily <unk> his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it	1161.6605
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything <unk> introduced into them	1893.8638
all villeforts influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dants had so nearly divulged	1565.1747
the riot	78.4017
well he said to the lieutenant	139.8877
you are only responsible for my body is it not so	474.5721
if i had them i should think myself as rich as <unk> then aloud are you ambitious as <unk> well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish the shadow of a cloud passed over aramiss face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape dartagnans observation	1778.0009
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words	1142.2914

besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of dartagnan resulted in the restoration of the <unk> he had lost	1461.8911
but no matter we must trust in god as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the <unk> and made a sign to one of the sailors who boat hook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved	743.7119
keep your <unk> it i <unk> never has too muchbut at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it it was offered with good will said dants	1819.8230
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag	821.9139
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive	884.3087
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake	1494.0225
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so	481.4331
no dear morcerf you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible	605.3689
i cannot now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no <unk> and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest	689.6954

it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants	475.8068
whose then is the air we breathe	493.5007
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	320.9629
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to dartagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him	623.5088
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost to die whilst doing a good deed	462.8663
italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head	758.4552
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that <unk> soul in that frail and delicate body	687.0079
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	470.3794
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dants where he was	454.0572
tell vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a journey an instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and spurred	514.8421

they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of <unk> <unk> which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to <unk> prefer my own specific undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you but i said monte cristo rising as he <unk> am gallant enough to offer it you <unk> how kind you are only remember one thinga small dose is a remedy a large one is poison	2366.9358
the three windows were still <unk>	905.8540
good heavens	721.6832
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not mordaunt replied by trying his opponents weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest	739.1065
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring chteau renaud with you beauchamp availed himself of alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight	508.1307

how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt m de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home	318.9886
this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dants had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it	1972.4108
bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something <unk> different from ambition	121.5353
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it	1080.6611
ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband guilty though he were	423.8206
winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp	1996.8765
this is all very easy for you to say replied dartagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without <unk> me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair	395.5186
and remember my life depends on your answer	1701.0940

not a modern picture among them	1391.7255

one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	402.9259
he could already see the <unk> beaming smile change to a <unk> of grief	285.3731
the english who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp	1932.9166

the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward	1123.0396
a thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected and rising also he went off at a quick pace	1097.5529

villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a housethe opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villeforts bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age	1048.1021
dartagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend	1227.2682
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress	388.4437
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren	783.7115
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour	827.4747
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting	1175.9358
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said dartagnan	424.4906
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	1534.0947
villefort approached noirtier	911.0299

dants himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them well when dants was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad	868.0259
the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward	933.2415
you prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips monte cristo turned to hayde and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek that is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason hayde sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow	1580.4979
to save yourselves to <unk> away to <unk> is good for the kings musketeers porthos and aramis trembled with rage	2358.1655
