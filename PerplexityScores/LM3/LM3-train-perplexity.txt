at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	818.6209
here i am  wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us  why all these precautions  you shall know  milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	1119.3848
ah let him say now if he does not recognize me each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair	715.7813

dants possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry	1468.9168
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you	655.5729
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality	819.5809
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence	700.4169
the first risk that dants ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven oclock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dants had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word	669.3730
you know noirmont do you not	733.4422
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family	600.3729

well then well do our best having said that they went out of the stable  well what matters all that to us said dartagnan	476.2603

dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows  this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you	320.4629
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out	744.6914
you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can you  no i really cannot  well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter  but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire  ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it	662.6174
bonacieux re entered	686.5602
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the htel de ville for this important evening	879.3813
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing  decidedly my dear athos said dartagnan i should like better not to risk anything  thats a pity said athos coolly	542.6569
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two oclock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the htel de londres	907.5222
gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old	2065.6658
the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and frjus urged dants to try and rise	753.2699
why does he go in secret	532.6627
i left it when i was but five years old replied hayde	579.2896
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman	651.9899
four men carried me from paris to chlons walking six leagues a day madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage	1121.2010
i should like to offer him a last salute	796.4136
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs	2011.7800
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you  you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to  it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	613.3708
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you	1103.9258
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him	832.7880
or dreamed he was and awoke mad  after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here  so the matter ended for the abb faria	513.1515
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity	1950.6877
you will not	205.5411
rene was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation	400.6531

ah heavens if it were that	437.4741
at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at oncetwo enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of carlo republican alliance	2052.7302
the brigadier had a moments hope	1643.7565
bonacieux what is that noise  that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness	593.5315
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemens coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door	552.0545
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god	1566.9711
enter my sister said the queen	296.4837
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to dartagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served	994.2877
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon	1254.0552
planchet grimaud bazin and mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from athos	1724.1006
what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be	314.9627
at each shot morrel turned pale	65.3989
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known  why so  because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields  the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	449.4519
we shall go together shall we not said albert to the count	342.7315
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing theres no need to go over the ground a second time  ah	1059.6198
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news  yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king  to the king	517.3979
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through me  yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i shall lose my honor felton and it is you you whom i make responsible before god and before men for my shame and my infamy  this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him	747.2194
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life  who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte cristo	510.9296
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman  i presume that she has returned to tours  to tours	447.8658
upon my word you did well to come back  nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start  its the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily	431.5866
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition	660.1543
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder	1296.4908
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name  and therefore said dartagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abb dherblay	340.5736
the count went out first then albert	726.4219
and you my lord  if i wish to leave  that would be much more difficult  why so  your eminence might be recognized  even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver	484.7380
good	79.8181
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her	689.4120
your mother albert knows that poor house well	983.8123
0165m    mercds was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast	558.6509
can i be of any use to you  chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	253.3348
then believe me it will be time to act  yes we will wait	452.7809
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward	1542.9724
and where is auteuil asked the count	465.1222
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream	642.9803
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	288.0396
tis more than possible answered the comte de la fere	1075.9127
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of dartagnan and athos	1431.5688
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be over  thats the last folly to be committed said athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy  but i can never escape said dartagnan with such enemies	733.2971
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor	1206.3994
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three oclock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight	1901.1011
what is life to younothing	1013.6069
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	389.3029
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down insensible	450.0835
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms	2334.3982
broussel  halloo	137.4212
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves	1562.9130
if you are not located in the united states  you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located  before using this ebook	396.4333
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	451.5304
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast  this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dants who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom	600.0041
mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him	462.7028
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer	816.5772
he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms	1025.7789
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole	527.9001
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity	963.5612
but he had gone farther than athosfor at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further	1643.2900
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him	480.9958
we discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going to day to learn something else  you really have some distrust then said porthos	546.8820
the road is never very safe during fair time  oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle	951.8255
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	829.0474
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter	341.1171
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man	1310.1401
dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was guarded	355.8573
chapter lx	1483.1547
i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening  morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening	677.9128
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going	752.5554
oh why did i not tell you all	296.8024
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring	430.9729
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	1204.0001
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years	1155.5651
thats it	118.1920
0147m    who could know that i was here already said the young man	242.2129
look and dartagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	634.7607
a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave	1161.7458
at a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free  ah	384.0925
what an injustice my dear invalid	885.9729
i ask you what year is it  the year 1829 returned jacopo	1032.4463
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier	802.7223
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	1791.9861
where is the child  villefort shrugged his shoulders	700.0486
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel	1172.5085
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it	365.5226
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	608.1780
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	1777.9500
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand	550.9526
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event	1306.8594
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient  bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket	656.5072
go to your chamber said she to mme	279.1955
i thought there were four of you  listen to me sir	353.2077
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts	1158.4208
to day the third will be there also  as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out  yes if your majesty releases them  ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris  why so  on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure  madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain paris with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein  anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand	379.8484
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed  alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again	1035.7870
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening	363.5622
20135m    from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life	772.6783
bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive	1449.3121
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better	549.8826
so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st germain	658.7258
i know how clear sighted your dreams are i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to you	1049.1116
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool	447.2674
are you hungry  humiliating as such a confession is i am	779.9157
this was the last blow to the prisoner	232.1872
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queens apartments	550.6860
but monsieur de trville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers  monseigneur is correctly informed said dartagnan	654.2728
what is the use of one horse for us two	268.5568

how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left  he is not a prince simply a count  a count and a rich one too eh  yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman  oh be easy	338.4359
monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart	852.4972
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault  do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied  and now we understand each other  when do you wish the carriage to be here  in an hour  in an hour it will be at the door  an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival	693.3156
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	1227.7422
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame he asked coldly	1368.1710
within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red dovecot  in that case i am lost said dartagnan	461.1866

go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you  although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior	1171.3137
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme	711.1969
enough	23.3817
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff	1522.8278
the idiot  how so if he loved her asked dartagnan	859.5580
he was a simple looking lawyers clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener	1352.0564
the king thanked m de trville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the bastille	1171.2345
the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him  you have no idea then morrel asked chteau renaud you do not propose anything  oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay  you have a sister asked the count	1191.4521
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i ami am  and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it	790.7401
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman	590.0766
this cant last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	800.6622
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy	714.4171
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you	451.5240
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence	731.9039
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way	503.0407
go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	824.3737
give up broussel she cried fine counsel indeed	1305.5581
dartagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friends house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni	673.8459
midnight struck	340.8159
oh the devil said porthos i am sorry for that it would have been one language more  when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded  ah	399.3945
do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor  do not exaggerate the service i have the happiness to render your majesty	458.3745
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago  20203m    no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	268.3819
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duelcalculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust	2013.2273
he therefore informed m morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleons return	460.4719
oh dearest marie	557.5190
speak i am ready to obey  no monsieur no i am not called louis the just without reason	570.8075
in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intacta piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor	557.5944
i had provided myself with a dark lantern	1135.8647
he let off his fire at but four paces	816.3467
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it  go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety	427.9824
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods justice  he will be found  well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required  your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fte given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	1016.0738
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him	413.7283
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was mad	1452.9615
m de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant	485.8545
and the other  which  the short one  oh he was not a gentleman ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration  some lackey murmured dartagnan	347.7002
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions	725.7371
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us	991.8146
who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house france his warda charming youth for we saw him in the campto fly to the aid of a rotten worm eaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel	1089.7258
the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned	52.4582
it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin  at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there	832.4418
i must go thither tonight  instantly	1273.6360
there however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank	944.2229
to what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind  now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everythingthanks and compliments we have plenty of time to spare  the two friends recalled by dartagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn	1281.3655
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men  and i may profit by monsieurs happiness and go to bed  yes go  may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur	813.9451
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man  sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet	1117.5837
she is quite well replied danglars quickly she is at the piano with m cavalcanti  albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristos eye was on him	778.2080
what is that line	613.3784
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended	999.9934
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	801.3845
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed	1564.4034
a large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her	924.1233
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	941.5132
you will take your place in the coup to chlons	673.0175
replace him on his orange horse and let him begone  not before i have killed you poltroon cried dartagnan making the best face possible and never retreating one step before his three assailants who continued to shower blows upon him	815.5791
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but dartagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her	480.3446
the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body	838.1722
madame said albert allow me to present to you m maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers  i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner	509.2814
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but im choked	864.7687
he criticised everybody humorously	1534.9021
who rang asked valentine	2410.9163
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat	843.8716
good god	1063.6143
so you defend him	575.8364
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening	632.9484
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter  meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine     chapter lii	1292.8140
all right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so	387.4784
at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to dartagnan that m dessessart made him a sign to approach	378.1579
louise slid through the half open gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward	2395.3538
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said athos	372.0593
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety	1023.2159
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden  i dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy  well replied athos have you not heard what dartagnan said  what did he say demanded porthos	1740.3593
athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king	225.2868
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame  oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable  but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there  insults  you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly	1462.1176
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue	383.4926
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion	664.8090
in 2001 the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg and future generations	622.9503
why really i know no one said the major	395.0663
soon the two gentlemen stopped also	683.8373
dartagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athoss and according to custom related everything to him	1056.9296
as ten oclock was striking dartagnan left m de trville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs dartagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane	789.3116
the fourth horse had arrived	1989.6796
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him  wretch exclaimed hayde her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery	909.5133
and of what malady  it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face  the smallpox	578.3121
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honor	1090.7371
she was a charming woman of twenty five or twenty six years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal	932.3151
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms	554.0244
there is a certain fatality in it  yes you are right dartagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us	641.2234
he again struck it and with greater force	777.0415
what is he looking at	271.1659
peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened	2393.0784
and in what part of auteuil do you reside  rue de la fontaine  rue de la fontaine exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone at what number  no	1211.7711
i hope these gentlemen have theirs  i will inquire said morrel	1230.2716
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd	1127.8984
there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he	331.4610
she had still four days before her	623.1399
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	939.7676
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion	489.7716
whilst this scene was going on dartagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze	804.4251
on leaving the paternal chamber the young man found his mother who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment	607.7249
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel m	842.9960
you ask that  put your two hands together	897.5457
justify yourself if you can	529.1807
supper was to be served at three and the clock of st jean had struck three quarters past two	752.0557
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us  all replied mordaunt	478.9186
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman  you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two oclock	1595.2943
uncertainty is worse than all  go on with the lights said the inspector	491.9711
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the carriage  this did not take long	1221.5721
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor	888.0971
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours  your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo  and who is beppo  oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle  indeed	376.4575
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness  20081m    oh they are simple enough replied the host	1083.1615
six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served up	749.7998
it would be exceedingly droll  the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	1333.0804
in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will	530.8568
where he was no one knew	294.6590
i hope i shall gain renes favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me	2123.4685
mistrust yourself john said he	994.9247
gentlemen good morning  as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage  bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m danglars  for heavens sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	775.4059
0039m    ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then  meaning to say replied dants with a smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a captain  eheh said caderousse shaking his head	707.5154
dartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment	726.9957
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings  dartagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos	737.0217
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum	1083.0964
you are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself  well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited  i require my lord that normandy should be given to madame de longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution	598.5316
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak  what became of you  as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me in instructed me in the calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family  and these researches  were fruitless chance did everything  you discovered what had become of your mother  i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i  oh	812.8839
the palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke	1109.6456
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all	578.8304
let me conduct your business and my own	578.9309
well bazin said dartagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	559.6334
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will	1418.7820
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which dartagnan had hitherto resided	457.1144
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express  surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance	1061.3263
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath	605.7679
oh my dear dartagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me	809.6843
now then what do you say to that  alas	300.6408
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage	388.4492
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience  but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does  oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god	1487.2373
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her masters orders	1132.1564

besides the appearance of the caravan was formidable	774.1328
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him	310.6231
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children  my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all  how in the wrong said athos	527.1458
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do	268.3792
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me	389.3588
40262m    until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down	1182.4238
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king	457.4932
no news had been received of them only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for aramis	756.5600
in prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious	1058.9373
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness  youre a great moralist and thats the fact said porthos	857.8439
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin  perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself  to them or to us do you mean aramis  to no one	770.7747
dont question me i beg of you but lend me a horse  my stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback	622.0219
he was very pale	508.1973
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief	745.0121
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal	607.4819
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	699.5981
a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way	588.3484
i speak to you in french said dartagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language	324.1319
0159m    owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dants	1144.4390
i cannot be mistaken there are your horses	885.0238
on approaching the house he perceived m bonacieux in morning costume standing at his threshold	924.9605
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence  not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences  but who perpetrated that joke let me ask	641.7174
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	1227.2787
i am the friend of the great cardinal  of the great cardinal  perhaps you would contest his right to that title madame  i would contest nothing but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister	268.2116
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated	1030.1797
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect	571.8414
why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother	443.7677
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest	447.3788
but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point  anne blushed and buried her face in her hands	554.4166
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is all powerful even with the king he would crush you at a word	942.9042
the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply	559.3770
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris	190.4155
bonacieux dead and dartagnan in a swoon	494.3688
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded	749.3680
50137m    but then you are richvery rich indeed continued debray taking out some papers from his pocket book which he spread upon the table	1142.5142
you ought i say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman	456.7830
we will explain in a few words how dartagnan had been led to choose that place of residence	614.2996
dants approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea	1536.9027
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureurs advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dants had rendered to the imperial causeservices which villeforts certificates rendered indisputable	678.0854
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him  and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him	349.0659
but what cared i for delays or difficulties valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me	830.5269
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon	923.9488
lord de winter perceived nothing of this	502.4654
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondys coachman	782.4427
they are beating the general alarm  the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	752.8138
what did he say to me	190.7937
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information  to auteuil cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividi go to auteuil  well what is there surprising in that	558.7501
see	25.6011
these cannot be for us said athos	344.8668
tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1700000 francs make nearly twelve millions	1654.1605
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	2085.7778
bigamy my dear	386.0014
precautions	47.7470
i ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt  humph said porthos	610.0505
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept	1509.4066
0301m    dants dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	1441.4865
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out  not that way if you please  gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way	1273.8273
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution	437.4199
presently the door opened and she perceived felton	438.0801
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance	585.8217
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him	698.6314
m de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man  there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars  because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing	441.7064
by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim	659.6732
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring	790.1532
old dants who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleons downfall	1798.3881
thank you thank you murmured she	569.9111
they must be enemies  he is right said porthos battle	573.9602

we were coming from syracuse laden with grain	1468.2531
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords	1370.3380
suddenly dartagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before	556.5138
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse	921.0825
suppose that the supreme being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was goodsuppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nighttheneven then mercds you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment  mercds looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude	1967.6650
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him	1042.9043
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos	1091.4763
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them i have not done so	495.7418
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough  madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing	647.7520
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth	1459.4359
athos stretched out his hand toward her	850.4772
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de mr or a vitry	1016.1159
how misfortune humbles a man  i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges	817.8885

just so gentlemen	877.2860
this was in fact a custom familiar to him	476.1307
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose	565.4364
i know no better means than to act with candor	1286.5850
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	712.2079
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos	1198.8688
oh you beautiful good little creature said milady	823.4206
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens	1366.2798
the fifth sharer in edmonds bequest was his own father  too true too true ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die  i learned so much at marseilles replied the abb making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dants i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end	1182.8994
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son	274.6611
on guard  but said he whom dartagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the pr aux clercs  what you say is full of sense replied dartagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely	603.8550
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence	335.7243

take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain let go the bowlins haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards  20041m    that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker  his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start	1495.0459
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you  what will you do in a foreign land an enemys country  i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and aramis too knows something of the language	392.0400

the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips	663.1620
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse	452.8317
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley	550.4655
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him	1301.0508

i have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so i swear	600.7839
is he much changed  he has become an abb that is all  you alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings  on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abb and you will find him a veritable soldier  could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten oclock on the pont du louvre  oh oh exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect  yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which i hope you will take your part  where are we to go my lord  to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her  this is an enigma said athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it i ask no further	525.8220
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance  fernand smiled piteously	1136.1643
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps	502.2857
i ask for it without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm	441.4396
since you demand my resignation i retire  then said aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	866.0674

help me out of paris help me out of france  i cannot take you however to the siege of la rochelle said dartagnan	413.3024

i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information  what day do you fix asked the president	489.7870
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing	977.7798

you can come he said and led them back to noirtier	449.5664
listen	78.3917
did you fancy yourself dying  no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape  the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dants	669.7156
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up  and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt  it is for that reason you see me so early  because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me  no because i passed the night writing lettersfive and twenty despatches	1442.2231
i do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of september it is ten years today since i saved your fathers life who wished to die  morrel seized the counts hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him	726.7292

let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together  impossible said dartagnan we are under mazarins orders  i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours  besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like dartagnan and porthos	562.6849
dartagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly	952.2573
oh dartagnan my beloved dartagnan	656.7139
no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	1271.0792
the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst ii have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable	700.3769
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith	1408.8174
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion  20175m    without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed	504.7561

to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself	1465.1709

when they entered dartagnans chamber it was empty the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp	1066.1730
yes monsieur said dartagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business  speak then i am all attention  it concerns nothing less said dartagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen  what did you say asked m de trville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon dartagnan	448.8030
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young mans shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size	1179.0531
however she offered the cardinal laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other	534.0747

well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar  porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed	538.3302

then arousing from his reverie  now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you  proceed said monte cristo	700.2927
pardon cried felton oh pardon  milady read in his eyes love	992.7722
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms  and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice	1296.7926
the ministers wife pardieu  oh your pardon	572.2954
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is	599.7766
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him	653.3303
this garden has never been a cemetery  what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently	1569.8152
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels	904.3501
there are in this bag three hundred pistoles	967.5876
these individuals are under arrest	1444.8341
i will say then monsieur quite short  you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for propriety	964.8058
i see	549.9634
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	1091.3977
appeared walking fast	644.9561
but the childthe child sir repeated the agitated mother	1827.4397
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this  so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace	696.6222
she returned to louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall	409.0162
i am not a banker like m danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is  i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell	497.9819
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification  the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance	444.5350
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar	690.0646
their number was great	934.2719
to reach englandathos lowered his voiceall france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed	2349.5310
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand	1145.3364
he will not go today said dartagnan but here ill pay you for us two  in that case let us go said the shipmaster	498.7834
the count opened the letter and read  m	412.5634
dartagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet	2314.3459
in fact the counts face brightened	2306.1016
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven oclock of the morning in the month of january  sir said planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know  tell us what returned dartagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains  sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort  perfectly one of my dearest friends  ah	820.7918
mercds raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her	596.8663
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume	1672.0662
fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god	539.0176
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance	700.7220
you will find in the same way four relays on your route	794.3772
a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure	866.6594
powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget28 the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebire	611.2374
julie mindful of emmanuels request was following her father when he quitted the room but he said to her quickly  remain with your mother dearest julie wished to accompany him	875.2803
i saw my fathers hand tremble	2427.3843
the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise	1269.1455
what is this  it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms  in your armsthat man	267.4835
then you know him almost screamed the countess	718.2985
lover and husband  chapter xix	2450.7693
was i not nearly your husband  50056m    and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd	1228.3068
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure	523.8759
each had his own particular visit to make	593.2166
what could this treachery be	1112.3750
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile	566.2070
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined  it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nmes to come to them as speedily as possible	964.0272
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dants had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	1578.7820
attend to yourself answer me dants waited expecting a question but in vain	875.1485
as dartagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen	651.3610
you know the history of the saraband  pardieu know it replied dartagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on	543.1830
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully	744.8221
fatality	12.8514
i have heard that name in greece  in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha  exactly so  this is the mystery said danglars	779.4224
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oclock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve  well said villefort what then  madame de villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir  where to  to the palais  what to do  my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial  ah said villefort with a startling accent does she wish that  the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress  villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails	521.5601
the cause was not in dants but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	565.7369
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here	861.5259
private secretary to a minister plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories possessing five and twenty thousand francs a year besides your place a horse for which chteau renaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockey club and other diversions can you not amuse yourself	1381.3965
the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword but the name of m de trville and that of m de la trmouille commanded a little reflection	510.3029
the violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to them	1043.3529
but what is the matter albert	334.1631
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains  his opinion of me is altered for the better then  no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings  he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine	479.8918
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses	1196.5906
are you there now  certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle  the fingers resumed the jesuit st	621.6880
this point settled the duke turned to dartagnan	613.7789
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his heart	619.7689
diavolo he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps	502.0015
gentlemen said de winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at parislet us separate to avoid suspicion	772.3110
ah	59.0386
do not forget that	462.0350
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last  in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dants did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbs chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed	681.0735
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was fernand that of my betrothed wasstay stay continued the abb i have forgotten what he called her  mercds said caderousse eagerly	863.6017
ah hes quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman indeed	782.5154
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	646.0995
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself  yes sir  then you have seen him  certainly i have  where	729.7176
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens	534.2708
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	620.2034
i do not know but he wishes to speak to you  ah said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult  i do not think that such is his intention said morrel	304.2243
bazin my friend come here  the door opened and bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair	631.7893
the bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges	535.2583
then replied mme	1269.6539
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth	1330.9933
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants visit	436.7588
caligula or nero those treasure seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for	1859.3606
what time do you breakfast albert  at half past ten  precisely asked debray taking out his watch	1259.9236
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us  my dear friend you guess well	1047.0221
how do you mean  the receipt of m de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschilds or lafittes and they will take it off your hands at once  what though payable at rome  certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5000 or 6000 francs  the receiver started back	577.9785
at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome	849.3133
and what a strange air for a victor  but you answered porthos seem to me agitated  theres a reason	834.4599
are you going  pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire  and what message shall i convey to the baroness  that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening  the third act had begun and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars	669.1997
during this time the abb had chosen his place for listening at his ease	539.3724
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you  dartagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	845.5295
shake handsi crave your friendship  sir said raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand i like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend i beseech you  and now where are you going viscount inquired de guiche	2151.0693
you were writing said monte cristo with a searching look	874.0362
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram	808.8460
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse  oh exclaimed dants his heart wrung with anguish	1193.4300
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	1881.6783
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head  the devil	364.3044
yes replied madame de villefort and would you believe it count  believe what  you think this house pretty do you not  i think it charming  well my husband would never live in it  indeed returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account  i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm	394.4648
it was like a besieged town	1047.8782
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear	710.5854
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there	1125.8099
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de winter	1205.1064
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him	368.2040
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation	540.9454
dartagnan i am your prisonertreat me as such  ah	756.4268
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security	522.4133
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in france that henry iv the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with m de bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard  yes said athos and the marechal has often told me so himself  then it was so murmured winter and the next day henry iv	951.2561
sit down there and eat in security	1048.6420
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by dartagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution	1003.5751
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him	644.3286
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best	675.7573
he sent us home in his own carriage	757.4274
and what do you know about them monsieur	418.7445
his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships	1212.8808
we must understand each other said the duke	498.8379
well mercds beloved by you i would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and i should become rich	885.4679
we have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause	801.6997
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman  the most satisfactory part of the matter said dartagnan is that there remains no trace of it  she had a son observed athos	552.6268
chapter xliii	1124.3372
i dont think the sides are equal  impossible for three reasons replied athos	1263.5400
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks	1470.6222
30169m    notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired	524.0720
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal	487.0124
you are discreetso much the better	1456.1222
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as trville	839.0475
the prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse	1508.4006
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol  but the comte de la fere asked the king	1414.0871
are you not well  tis nothing nothing it will soon pass awayand as he said so the old mans strength failed him and he fell backwards	778.1880
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just nowblood will have blood	1498.1881
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence  well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence	1243.5355
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous teresa gave him oneonly instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo  what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him  was a lad of fifteen replied peppino	1350.2140
dartagnan	55.8227
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen	957.4619
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation	658.4905
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	1271.5837
this began to be annoying	1218.9451
he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there	1234.2478
the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence andlet us admit itthe involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak	1477.3961
good evening comrade said dartagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner	984.0291
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might failfor felton was forewarned and that against the least chance	1204.7675
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected	1084.3212
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness	829.6335
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	1356.9095
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely	755.4579
what chance brings you here gentlemen said chteau renaud shaking hands with each of them	1228.7427
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be	600.0241
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the same	469.9044
i only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions  the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret squabble	323.9350
do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer	252.4765
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage	668.2297
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	758.0062
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and dartagnan remained master of the field of battle	871.6950
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance  alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good  oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm	628.0674
if she seduced your brotheryou said she seduced him did you not  yes  if she caused his deathyou said that she caused his death  yes repeated the executioner	877.5052
you are in a hurry captain  danglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercds said just now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck  your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the pharaon cannot be under weigh again in less than three months  we are always in a hurry to be happy m danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune	504.6618
he made a great start and looked at me	416.8591
there were nobles who made war against each other there was the king who made war against the cardinal there was spain which made war against the king	638.4132
porthos was the first who came to himself	176.6344
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	1443.8849
frightful	54.4978
your history is a terrible one mr mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an all powerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information  my lord to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other  but this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwells person	1277.0031
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about  on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man	413.8943
dartagnan interpreted it with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of cahusac crying to me monsieur guardsman i will slay you  cahusac turned	655.5669
call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers	366.2500
did you not yet know me	286.5301
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	603.4607
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice dont touch them  devil take me if i taste one of them murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry  there was silence	779.8444
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon	947.9696
what can i say more asked monte cristo	578.4717
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named	906.7820
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir	1070.1464
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voiceso trifling indeed that dartagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man	1369.5515
they waited upwards of ten minutes	488.4842
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa	1008.3162
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	636.5723
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no	362.0115
when the hour for his jailers visit arrived dants straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place	818.8094
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend	1030.1385
the evidence will support it	2103.0610
your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels  what then  amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv  well  in these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with  the fattest among them cried dartagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing	668.6820
de motteville will not be astonished at this reply	971.0222
holland loved her and she responded to his love  madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion	783.4832
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dants inquired the abb of caderousse	881.2905
well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars  i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head  what fortune has she  but i tell you  a million  andrea shrugged his shoulders	684.4319
what do you intend to do	363.9249
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments qurens quem devoret	899.9413
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom	832.4358
towards the evening of the third day	214.9705
that monsieur dartagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king	358.5117
albert followed him with the count	216.5597
you are a man of taste	330.9124
ah pardon	1307.0914
you did well to defend the honor of a woman and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth  monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood  therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone  the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward  judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal	387.9605
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever	642.0897
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me	316.1659
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life	434.0370
do these belong to the cardinal	404.9981
come now he said	198.3859
groslow said aramis the devil	289.5885
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night  are you quite sure of that  certain	1792.7827
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself  hear me count replied dartagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts  i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur dherblay	480.8355
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old	846.0364

it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered	380.5868
all faithful hearts with me cried out winter	1182.1239
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner  in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abb busoni	405.6957
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wifes chamber and found dartagnan just recovering his senses	382.4736
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another  to whom  to the king  to the king  yes  i dare not write to his majesty  i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m de salvieux to do so	291.7726
what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar	347.2724
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity	1745.1357
here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman  to fontainebleau replied eugnie with an almost masculine voice	693.3837
i am the queen do you recognize me  no madame replied dartagnan	403.9611
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted	839.3092
she has never been so kind before	914.3636
from athos cried dartagnan recognizing the handwriting	1502.6519
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress but milady started up pushing her away	1201.9500
we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor	579.3636
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him	519.5168
he then arose	1938.6976
he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation	1080.1299
confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	1049.0386
nothing good replied dartagnan shaking his head	712.9180
this was to go himself to m de la trmouille	449.8460
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path	421.6649
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee  my word of honor sir said athos	813.5023
your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it  and so my dear count said dartagnan his eminence didnt actually insist on our attending him it is du vallon and i who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you  at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise	685.9826
do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel  dear good rene whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker	911.9901
well said the count	109.1483
m de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of pre lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates	1522.6776
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot	898.8168
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top	1290.0946
the following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count	693.1732
the felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave to night we have nothing more to do here  you are in a hurry sir count said dartagnan	481.8658
come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly	797.8481

you may join me at the htel des gardes	1707.9000
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said caderousse laughing	531.2505
it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said porthos	745.3575
dants struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices	1301.0941
yes i share your hopes the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent	573.1935
oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends	251.3191
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue	487.5834
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but i know he must be so at present  we thought so too monsieur	428.6936
well said rene i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your owna physician for instance	2265.2771
tell me what i must do this time are there any fresh instructions	635.7915
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse	849.9708
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence   well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you  what do i see in it  yes what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer  it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand  did your father serve under ali pasha  yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny  oh my dear viscount do talk reason  i do not desire to do otherwise  now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person	748.7401
its nothing its nothing said milady	841.6289
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers	340.5649
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot	1065.7826
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	585.5558
do not lie my angel said dartagnan smiling that would be useless  what do you mean	718.8566
pardieu replied dartagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables  and i some lamb chops said porthos	494.0969
dartagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in their formation	412.0976
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies	1352.1985
this time said athos first breaking the silence dartagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once  the devil	712.6362
a letter from the king perhaps	380.4400
he is scarcely five feet high  bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair paulet it is high time to put little voiture in his right place	1766.3916
the count laid his hand on franzs shoulder	1731.0912
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell	696.6142
he took monte cristo aside	2125.9824
both had recently come into the country	805.0160
it would be but an unsafe retreat	1466.3837
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person	658.6790
and is not this daughter dead demanded monte cristo i fancy i have heard so  yes monsieur one and twenty years ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times  thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the stewards utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it	604.2543
go on dartagnan	235.9430
xxii	33.3190
but dants was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybodys professions of friendship	1161.9608
the timely arrival of dartagnan in paris	1218.0834
but then he may have stopped at saint germain  i dont think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette  i was there this very day  and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling	846.6422
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniardi am a cosmopolite	754.5169
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile	856.5176
he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke	627.3152
you are at liberty to speak m de morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence i assure you albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner	416.0779
neither dared for some time to speak in that room	474.0296
yez whats the dream said the swiss	731.6269
you hear madame  yes sire i hear stammered the queen	969.8038
see planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like you  ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak  it was decided that planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart	497.4827
then when the cardinal had ended  alas sir	763.7958
oh saved saved cried she	1668.3286
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to monsieur abb	1119.3015
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape	1855.7910
there is an excellent tavern at compigne well remembered by those who have ever been there	1123.4680
you were saying my dear friend  no i said nothing  yes you were saying you wished to leave this place  ah indeed	448.3962
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles	803.4920
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	407.1398
you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp said albert with increased though stifled anger	1708.7155
there he cried	234.5577
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	260.8343
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences  valentine seized the counts hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips	983.4080
the abb made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	618.1733
milady shuddered	895.8414
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon	491.2892
does he still live inquired the innkeeper	896.8364
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations	1322.6272
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length dartagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick	1000.0487
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock	635.5718
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it	945.3564
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar  sausages  athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person	528.9559
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat	1000.8273
a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar	464.0833
silence silence begone said kitty	141.2900

we too said athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from england but have just come from there  what	524.6033
then there is his son andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his fathers millions	903.8656
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction	596.4088
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i cannot understand how any man can really love her  the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison  no but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars  i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	481.0591
but you know him m de morcerf  is it that excellent m bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well  yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerin fact everything	1079.9244
her crimes i know them not her disorders i know them not her vices i know them not	679.6946
40046m    yes  you cried franz whose hair stood on end you m noirtieryou killed my father  yes replied noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man	1455.3044
she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion	588.8842
everything was in readiness	550.2333

suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	1156.1366
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by them  never fear  theres ten oclock striking at greenwich  groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich	623.9686
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note abovenothing can be done  he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in villeforts handwriting	1204.7537
i never had one	443.0875
the agamemnon of aeschylus is based on this legend	919.3493
in an instant dants plan was formed	1226.6603

it was necessary to reach m de trville it was important that he should be informed of what was passing	464.4396
five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married	2007.5167
you know dear dartagnan i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman	816.2319
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented  valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed  sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult  valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins  poisondeath exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir  50071m    hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death	892.0179
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos	556.7410
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort	281.8550
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count  it appears so sir replied monte cristo	711.6356
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached	716.8043
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	1233.3195
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor	637.4608
to his friends m de villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the law made man	655.3962
poverty overtook you	2394.5305
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning  i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply  if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave  mordaunt bowed	523.1874
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles	775.6818
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	706.2733
there only his memory returned to him	399.2502
well said milady i have not seen our gascon this evening  what milady	503.1996
he had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry	1288.4138
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration	630.5622
she wept abundantly andlet us speak it to the praise of m dartagnan the youngernotwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half	883.7173
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows  the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner	526.5245
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo	702.4578
no be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere long	801.2412
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the alles de meilhan was obtained	940.8351
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and dartagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends	515.9175
dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work	1282.5221

how do i know	277.6466
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chiefs consent did the same	1106.9752
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti	484.6125
you see its evident where the count got the name  but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me  in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success  i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him  i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not	523.9614
oh	67.9007
is it because my opinions differ from yours  nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement	770.8022
she cried out but davrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left	774.8566
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace	263.3210
that is my condemnation thought dartagnan he will spare me the ennui of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial	529.9976
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	707.6656
confiteor said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry paralyzed  have you finished said andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat	1248.7426

the storm broke about ten oclock	1365.3937
i will repair it indeed i will my dear porthos  besides what did i ask of you resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship	485.9331
at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers	1388.1401
you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand	737.0357
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dants father the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile	1563.7225
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	847.0516

no monsieur it is impossible i can go no farther  what does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo	807.8246
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote  to mlle	1310.6963
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you	444.0261
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants	493.4543
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	888.9428
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock struck	427.1536
all my researches have been useless	1210.5358
in that case i should beat a retreat	829.2680
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	314.4111

ah this visit was expected	881.5423

he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage	773.4849
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject	967.7357

monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it	615.0123
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal	2308.0300
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured  oh valentine  the counts heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young mans shoulder said  i was looking for you my friend monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly  you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot	1406.8505
what you dont know me  no monseigneur  well two words will refresh your memory	1079.9950
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tongue tied	832.1470
you are acquainted with the scriptures  dartagnan thought of the appointment mme	726.7905
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine  it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	1024.4855
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and stupid  porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew dartagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose	1318.0032
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age	1168.4486
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles	553.4725
and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters the pharaon morrel  son of marseilles she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo	1022.3533
four men surrounded him besides the postilion	1519.2196
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival	529.8912
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard	937.8382
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers study	763.2303
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed  he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper	949.2832
i cannot see	1187.2719
memory makes the one philosophy the other  but cannot one learn philosophy  philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven  well then said dants what shall you teach me first	1446.2953
i wont have dants killedi wont  and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied danglars	1868.3646
before daybreak m de wardes must take his departure still in obscurity	1637.2097
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret	661.7743
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	527.3255
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for gods sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us	837.5761
and a little bit of a thief  oh sir	655.5963

when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other comrades	940.8691
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say  but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair  he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed  and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise  a hundred louis  well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something	232.1314
we started a stag of ten branches	858.5442
like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every means of attack and defence i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials i taught my arm to slay my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles	1778.3883
at what time  six oclock  where  at saint mande  who told you  the count de rochefort  some one drew near	922.0528
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her	354.9068
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up	1226.5339
mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees	708.1456
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself	390.3059
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter	585.4971
bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband	294.3263
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankers as the betrothed	590.7436
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death	412.6669
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard	739.3021
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself	531.2614

as we pass from one room to another i will open the windows to let you breathe  monte cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor	457.5375
all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter	1194.2928
you who have chateau meadows mountains woodsyou who have forty thousand francs a yearyouarenothappy  my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity  surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate  porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	1200.5854
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours	934.8730
i know not why but i feel that this crime  you acknowledge then the existence of the crime  yes i see too plainly that it does exist	400.7289
and are the first of men added dartagnan	299.4058
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	966.8423
luigi slowly relinquished teresas arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille	2341.6794
monsieur dartagnan sides with mazarin	1007.8619
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	496.0965
but let us make haste sir with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost  oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness	311.5704
zounds	52.1274
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound	1588.5006
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you  30165m    noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	1200.5615
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology  gentlemen gentlemen said dartagnan do not let us lose our time in jesting	678.1685
i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned itwithout any fault of mine i can honestly declare	1373.3523
i am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world	553.9478
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open	1046.4906
are you strong the abb asked one day of dants	406.0930
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime trees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south	1310.7812
in five minutes they gained the land	1632.0996
i will make verses said he	788.1315
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility	1768.8588
you remember what a beautiful night it was	495.0083
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard  gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window	815.2272
well yes you have to know me yet	245.2079
jump then monsieur pistache  but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	702.0500
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically	1146.7069
let me overtake him  he	667.5351
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet	1416.4465
among these two hundred levees that of trville was one of the most sought	547.0886
the approach was not such as to prepossess peoplean ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand chtelet	723.6933
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow	838.3293
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolnesssuch qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of dartagnan they attracted his admiration	768.9846
i came to pray over the body of your daughter  and now why are you here  i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do  good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abb busoni  no the abb threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face	360.6581
they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	1133.0345
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kittys in bringing it but at the first words she read she became livid	664.0600
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness	817.3667
this feeling lasted but for a moment	809.7144
the king has nothing like it  no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin	569.7367
at length he interrogates me said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result	830.3300
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly	1287.2803
mans whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them	1229.4177
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him	457.2186
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall	702.3581
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	549.2764
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone  monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it	956.4621
adieu sir  one wordone single word more doctor	1595.7605
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine  two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionfernand and danglars  how was this jealousy manifested	546.4996
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon	1076.3673
my father died but i did not die	620.2501
five answered groslow one every two hours  dartagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthoss nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive	456.1570
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for  the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms	370.7859
but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody  you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him	591.7529
i read it a little while since	658.1013
he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge	785.6542
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos	525.9852
let each take seventy five that is enough to take us to london and back	642.5349
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis	443.3282
the journey   at two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrire st denis	1342.6995
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity	1807.0641
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon	860.3928
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground	625.8327
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson	319.1713
see	72.3801
aramis assumed that perilous charge	1199.0287
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me  0233m    the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dants	1229.1891
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet	978.0977
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner	559.6745
mother said the young man looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened	950.9178
dants remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abb was madsuch a conviction would be so terrible	649.1025
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but to day is not the proper time to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman  at the first words of this address dartagnan had seized porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	415.9483
the countess de winter   as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from dartagnan not all that had happened but what dartagnan himself knew	713.1057
bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanrue de la fontaine no	668.2176
my friend continued morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waitingtoday is the fifth of october he took out his watch it is now nine oclocki have yet three hours to live  be it so said the count come morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it	568.2902
adieu	60.3810
that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want  we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself	550.2296
it is well as it is say no more about it  at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wifes secrets	315.8404
ah there you are my good darminges i have given you a great fright have i not	404.1005
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible	802.5332
unfortunately said monte cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck  poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts  indeed said danglars becoming pale	848.4127
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter	1868.4904
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was omitted  go on go on said dartagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come	830.7161
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized	530.0559
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will  turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him  never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart  do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said dartagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon  the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle	588.5822
the count knit his brow	566.5057
ah	50.3498
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals guards who recognized dartagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning	483.7398
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant  yes  well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot  so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you  certainly	535.1311
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees	668.8586
she goes into england said athos	1235.1039
16 the god of fruitfulness in grecian mythology	2144.5925
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal	726.2318
give him a lesson debray  stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived  what is it  it is she  whom do you mean  they said she had left  mademoiselle eugnie said chteau renaud has she returned  no but her mother  madame danglars	643.8835
what then would be the use of all i have suffered	295.5477
well madame unhesitatingly repeated debray	333.3771
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean	878.7962
his majesty has so good a heart that he cannot understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason	681.0030
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it	459.2450
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked	793.9421
now said aramis we know how the matter stands	708.9886
your  dartagnan	286.0517
i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me  well inquired dants	545.5461
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it	543.3737
do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard she opened noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily	472.7095
simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room  ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar  grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton	1038.5308
dartagnan hits on a plan	1116.1862
but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not  oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for	709.3724
you are a capital companion dartagnan said he your never failing cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction	1582.6941
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich	343.2683
a written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his majesty and the ill treated people have drawn up the following which i have the honor to present to your majesty  and is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman replied trville haughtily	1118.4170
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart	443.0139
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed	72.7714
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	1049.4308
he then concluded it must be an assassin	1081.3683
my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence	1071.6052
by my fathers tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you hayde that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me  i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him	838.8519
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again	546.2734
m coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities	1097.4858
all four once more together	1617.5278
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason  madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de larbre sec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	598.7442
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously	690.1110
do you wish to go on the water sir said the sailor	295.3477
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with  there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	468.0236
on our honor as gentlemen  then i may tell you all	457.5331
he therefore told him all	703.9772
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states	1709.0658
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that	706.5064
he continued  so i was going away but he called me back	448.9231
then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his valet de chambre patrick	869.1777
40070m    from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going	583.7593
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes  i think it is a fine country said hayde but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous  so young said albert forgetting at the moment the counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name  hayde turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured  speak  nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness  40068m    speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say  hayde answered his remark with a melancholy smile	1018.1830
dartagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described	683.3248
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper  yes sir for all ive had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it	1493.9227
row porthos row and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further	1580.6312
free without my aid	986.4739
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose	1734.6028
who knows	509.0139
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid	942.3068
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	719.6297
his musketeers proceeded and followed him	1006.8724
bonacieux saw that he hesitated	609.0466
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action	895.6620

then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor	592.0636
no less said athos as pale as a corpse	504.9670
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for dartagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin	1852.3669
dartagnan pressing his hand repeated his call	1064.3418
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos	2093.2166
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos	822.4800
why did we not destroy the child with the mother  what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves	630.6867
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress  0303m    but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked dants of himself	568.9030
where and how  thats true  fore gad these frenchmen have no consideration  i had forgotten that england was an island and that you were the king of it  go to the riverside ask for the brig sund and give this letter to the captain he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen  the name of that port  st	1991.3804

time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose	928.5579
he will inform against you	812.0974
how can i tell	436.7761
his eyes remained open and menacing	1367.1829
meanwhile the heat became excessive	1001.7628
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered  my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said  20222m    it was  well then did he ask you who is m albert de morcerf	451.3042
go make out my bill and notify my servant  what monsieur will you leave us so soon  you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse	724.3945
dartagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends	672.8044
she would have taken dartagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache	309.5979
what was i saying	309.6801
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dants who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father	1105.4187
bicarat was a gascon as dartagnan was he turned a deaf ear and contented himself with laughing and between two parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword here cried he parodying a verse of the bible here will bicarat die for i only am left and they seek my life  but there are four against you leave off i command you  ah if you command me thats another thing said bicarat	602.8291
a good mother cannot depart without her son  villefort could not believe his eyeshe could not believe his reason he dragged himself towards the childs body and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub	1087.5695

i shall be happy to meet you again sir  may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish murmured dartagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard	1041.1334
it is an old mans caprice  and is there no means of making him revoke his decision  yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor  the count who perceived that m and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds water glass	997.3243
you hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty minutes  i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train  my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do ones self is ever well done i shall abide by that rule  grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it	2235.4724
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed	661.3815
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	1115.1398
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window	640.0922
the old servant came	1643.2620
dartagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning	1401.4125
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again	1132.3687
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle	552.3505
the pharaon he cried the pharaon  whatwhatthe pharaon	1169.8915
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	350.2389
be easy i am a gentleman	543.3900
and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him	693.0823
what number was it that rang  number 3  run waiter  at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled	1675.6683
the count de guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by raoul who came to wish him good day	520.2707
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	493.4689
ah said gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all france might hear it that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty  exactly your man  bravo	1499.4073
she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not  she was of a noble family of fiesole count  and her name was  do you desire to know her name  oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it  the count knows everything said the italian bowing	375.4470
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand  yes said dartagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose  oh said porthos you cant think that dartagnan  dartagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	520.8620
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	658.9803
my dear m cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father  the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice  nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50000 francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent  the major looked anxiously around him	619.1978
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor drank	839.9850
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them	579.9029
adieu my lord  adieu my dear rochefort  ah monsieur mazarin monsieur mazarin said rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action  it was half past nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of st jacques de la boucherie	1037.5652
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death  sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you  i am called the count de guiche continued the young man my father is the marechal de grammont and now that you know who i am do me the honor to inform me who you are  i am the viscount de bragelonne answered raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the count de guiche had done	589.7430
i remember now  milady looked around her as if in search of something	728.6926
look at me madamelook around me	1326.8997
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julieemmanuel emmanuel  monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count	1113.4280
and i too said dartagnan	233.5871
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor	393.1399
no sir	964.3766
as they were going down dartagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader	636.8702
the devil replied the prince surely at the death of mazarin	522.0652
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a drought  come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration	2034.8772
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the htel and went to his apartment	1070.0576
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with  but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady	526.8233
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes	1339.8273
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say	425.1786
dants perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercds glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond	962.6469
two hours passed away	2191.2112
yes said cromwell you have done since i knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave soldier  do you remember sir it was my idea the scotch treaty for giving up the king  yes the idea was yours	471.4624

madame say that you would love me then	280.9634
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow	530.7449
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength	1054.3337
old dants however sprang forward	318.6981
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the htel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage	576.2828
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed	786.7883
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you  but from whom is that letter  oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette from madame de chevreuses chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchesss coronet  what do you say  hold	283.9393
and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts  do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied athos	449.5820
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort  why not  becausei scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it  is it so	1246.1116
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last  and milady stretched out her arms to mme	443.5024
mme	45.5688
i am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right  reassure yourself madame i will answer for the kings safety  as he left the queens presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	957.5920
in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearancean enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves	2232.6365
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist	1442.7727
you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed  yes  you are mistaken	1015.8762
not at all	228.8487
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them	1511.3267
like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass	1061.9464
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	656.3257
come	25.3448
project gutenberg is a registered trademark	1686.6877
we will try and carry him on board the tartan  dants declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him	939.2559
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious  in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	481.4382
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	462.8913
dartagnan cried athos my son i entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him	402.7578
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too	727.2849
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	1934.8623
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving dartagnans composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands  yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge  you accept however  i always accept  do you think the thing possible  everything is possible  shall you be attacked on the road  probably  and what will you do in that case  i shall pass through those who attack me  and suppose you cannot pass through them  so much the worse for them i shall pass over them  and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain  yes  on your life  on my life  you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration	615.8090
as to that you must leave it to me  i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like  dartagnan shook his head	522.0879
what shall i say to the cardinal  you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay and of surrendering only to fifty men	224.1855
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter  the answer to madames replied kitty all in a tremble	729.7311
my lordescape	1440.6974
ha	56.5834
alas anything you please	980.0581
it was useless to search at night and dants therefore delayed all investigation until the morning	1068.7347
then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required athos would no more give him his handathos would renounce him	441.0118
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond studs	384.7029
he would have spoken but his voice failed him	629.1588
his friend	1026.9598
acknowledge that if albert is brave he cannot be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise  doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday  you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation	543.9051
ah said the doctor is it you  yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone	248.2087
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph	877.2643
he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedyes it is all from the same cause  make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true  oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered  beware morcerf he is already an old man  i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally	610.4745
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned	805.6688
he still lives  are you quite sure of it  i am he  there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature	430.5516
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines	1779.9111
send your saddle then to the htel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours  very well but it is already five oclock so make haste  a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue frou on a very handsome genet	474.3760

a cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the cur summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night	1223.4446
where has he gone  i do not know  what do you mean	372.1411
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you  is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information  let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob	827.5860
ah said he i hear a human voice edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron	669.0035

i did not observe it yesterday  it must be the fog rising from the river said the king	571.8070
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment	375.9497
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now athos come  athos was about to retire	567.8419
what i most loved after you mercds was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men that strength was my life	642.7433
but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a days journey before me who followed him on foot	960.1429

bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue	538.5403
the blood no longer flowed from his wounds	2359.7898

albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering  these papers become more and more stupid every day  a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m lucien debray	544.6549
come reflect and decide  your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied dartagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely  dartagnan paused	1230.8743
i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain i have punished him for his injustice that is all  de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility	861.2343
dartagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight	1044.3973
was that it  if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said dartagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like  these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery  at all events answered dartagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords  he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	479.9169
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 october 1633  it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse	1106.1453
but you dartagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally	269.1839
all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start	663.0795
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell  oh	574.6793
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise dartagnan had made and opening the door said come in  all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that dartagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard	842.0862
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action	1721.1165
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honor	600.8661
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me  parbleu what do you desire it to be  what do you want  would you like to know  certainly  well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one  you jest i presume  i never jest  let me pass  you shall not pass  my brave young man i will blow out your brains	567.9768
comte de wardes   not a word about the sapphire	739.6942
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul	677.0784
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	257.1266
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse	937.5694
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv	917.5025
read he said	94.2657
let me know what crime i have committed	643.1489
the vendomois road he replied	2031.6506
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages	858.3894
oh let them come in	430.5258
i would take the hundred pistoles	617.4765
and what favor pray asked lord de winter	1276.4807
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly	1442.1805
why so  i play with monsieur du vallon every night	1209.7960
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	1423.1251
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his fathers right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus  i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either	899.4282
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	1199.3217
oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself i should run mad	428.2061
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	655.0819
oh tis heretis heretis overmy sight is gonemy senses fail	479.0823
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying  thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers  cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns	1197.1647
i cannot consent that this woman should die thus  milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope	896.5927
dartagnan looked and was seized with pleasure	519.2899
i had acted hastily towards him	1812.9434
im afraid we are prisoners whispered dartagnan to his friend	806.8068
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again  pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment  why so	470.6053
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson  french of rome  i am glad to hear it baronfor i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants	501.4945
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice	1550.3199
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks	558.6517
my friend said aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity	1981.3130
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good  ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered  my poor girl you know him already  i know him  yes it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son  the count of monte cristo  the same  ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine  the friend of madame de villefort	1010.6084
planchet waited towel on arm fourreau uncorked the bottles and brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters	2304.9507
franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it	406.4692
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the first	979.0595
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port	409.6135
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends  there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis	735.9836
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her  i cried buckingham	1260.9628
he he murmured she can it be he and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed	369.1499
ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed dartagnan	898.1627
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow	1054.3845
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me  you may  shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	345.3439
do you want any money  no sir i have all my pay to takenearly three months wages  you are a careful fellow edmond  say i have a poor father sir  yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	856.6066
the devil exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord	1052.1255
did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it  but what danger threatens him then emmanuel she asked	2314.1804
in the chamber of dartagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	417.6230
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him	228.2859
you understand my dear girl continued dartagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in  oh my god	518.4719
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expectedone is weak	534.3404
hush returned rochefort	1193.9529
her hands are icy cold cried dartagnan	1585.1365
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira	2089.6562
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius  well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way  at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest	1058.8737
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him	823.3935
come back sirs back  the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard	897.6501
psbe it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for youfor you as aramis  athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear	595.0328
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you  gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man  i cover mine said dartagnan	408.9755
his presence produced a good effect	2217.7627
at last i mastered my agitation	321.2298
but dartagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	525.8362
tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio	1372.4155
it will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck  the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said  this block is very low is there no other to be had  it is the usual block answered the man in the mask	661.2330
that is the hour when i am expected  madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus	434.9651
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable  hold your tongue	557.3373
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st leu being not far from that locality	615.2463
pardon my lord said felton stopping the duke but does your grace know that the name of charlotte backson is not the true name of this young woman  yes sir i know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink	778.5235
why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other  my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you  but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude	640.3553
the mother and daughter passed the night together	740.2130
every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture	865.4722
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dants turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand  comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going	760.4905
she ran to the window and opened it	265.7786
you see we were quite right to pacify that country  yes but don carlos  well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen  you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry  i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning  well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time  about what  about the papers  my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers  then you will dispute the more  m	573.3685
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door	751.6295
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo	445.3847
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badlyas witness chalais and mme	308.1403
now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon  capital exclaimed albert your breakfast shall be waiting  where do you live  no	447.5925
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything  milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	767.3521
bonacieux entered	1730.6454
you may retire we consent to that	811.0316
what do you wish for	281.3127
de wardes i know it cried dartagnan	547.0325
but what shall you do with him  with whom  with albert  what shall i do with albert	283.6252
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	1534.2023
only continued m davrigny with a slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for i will come no more	1141.8018
no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation	1456.1367
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of dartagnan and porthos in their hands	448.0518
grimaud made a sign that he was going away	322.5367
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat	978.9348
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh	566.7443
what then  ah my dear count said albert	501.5562
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes	699.6639
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	1201.4458
treat him kindly therefore in the future  captain said the young king to dartagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to dayyou and your friend the baron du vallon  that was a great honor for dartagnan and for porthos	367.5873
i will give them to you on condition that you let me go  why do you offer me 4000000 for what is worth 5000000	480.7610
dartagnan looked with surprise at his friend	503.3114
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	1104.1243
a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrire saint martin	685.3493
felton and he addressed patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same moment	982.2865
but go on signing said monte cristo i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars  the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary	776.4507
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him  valentine blushed but did not answer	934.0220
the ambassadors	1547.4276
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name	388.4678
you are right sir and no one can doubt my position  these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray	480.7775
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly	577.7654
will you examine them  oh m beauchamp if you assure me that m de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient  gentlemen said chteau renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is franz and debray  the two young men he announced were indeed approaching	858.2723
i am just setting out for blois	1954.3551
he never spoke of women	1220.8058
you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	487.5973
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber	673.4700
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice	1915.1913
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	1006.3055
and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fathers head  yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man	474.7883
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	680.6488
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles	1198.8590
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me  but does he not approach the walls while playing  your eminence doesnt know those walls they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off  hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable	310.9087
the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count i accept the count returned to young morcerf	374.0897
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitors cross the carriage was taking the direct road to it	578.3460
as to fortune he had madehe humble as he wasan enemy of the cardinal that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king	453.9687
and clement vii but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work	1940.4938
you positively recognize m de morcerf as the officer fernand mondegoindeed i do cried hayde	1986.0178
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls  you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything  what would you have said dartagnan	927.2462
it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads  dartagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap	978.7729
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness	653.6588
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung  the deuce they do said mousqueton i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war then  porthos meantime asked dartagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey	750.4000
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched	1109.3628
and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv  it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twenty seventh the name of porthos and at the thirty first the name of aramis	952.3798
oh curses woe death to you  he tried to follow monte cristo but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spothis eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire	596.7556
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject	1013.8771
these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert he felt his heart beat and taking his mothers hand within his own he said tenderly  yes you will live  i shall livethen you will not leave me albert  mother i must go said albert in a firm calm voice you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you besides i have signed  50145m    you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven  not my own wish mother but reasonnecessity	800.6915
the two things agree marvelously well  i am all attention said dartagnan	1165.5979
here  you decide then nothing about me my lord  on the contrary i have come to a decision  bernouin came into the room	515.9724
these steps came on came fast	1966.3828
yes you are right a furlough is needful  still another obstacle murmured mme	1953.8417
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight	1614.9214
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat  mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	784.3995
that is all i require	366.9782
after a moments interval cocles appeared	571.8611
dants concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor	736.9722
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker	1599.1229
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty	463.0136
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold	507.2555
is it not a joke said danglars	395.7805
this will teach you said dartagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion  god	968.7731
dartagnan bent down to his horses neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat	728.3438
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness	1872.0388
the pleasure of seeing you	470.8421
of course said he of what else should i speak  mr	615.4380
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table	781.5023
what do you mean by a struggle	501.8981
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember  what do you mean my lord  i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience i have but you in the world hayde through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice  do you hear him valentine exclaimed hayde he says that through me he will sufferthrough me who would yield my life for his  the count withdrew for a moment	408.6088
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all  what brother cried milady must i name him again	324.5247
oh it was cruel to us anddare i say itto you also  listen my friends said the counti may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know	1299.7976
at the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his master	525.9336
good evening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay  yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars	402.2987
well asked the abb as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do  to tell you all i know was the reply	314.8016
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister  my father said the young man bending his knee bless me morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said  oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you	338.7874
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee  truly  honor	749.8041
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions  well what next said dartagnan laughing in spite of himself	1648.5500
whereupon grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	1058.0721
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childs room  50101m    do you wish to see him  i only wish to be alone	183.6180
this fashion is coming in	832.3553
well why should not we too belong to a party	650.6606
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture	791.6916
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time	329.2162
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king	926.9929
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent	750.6469
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father	759.3983
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	427.5035
do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing	508.8268
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water i left half because it seemed so bitter noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak	659.9995
make less hubbub and think more deeply	2291.9062
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter	892.2978
on her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously	615.8593
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand	640.7589
oh my heart	485.0525
he has come thought milady	1023.4089
my dear count cried morcerf you are at faultyou one of the most formidable logicians i knowand you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist	1090.2009
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife  felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand	893.5103
my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity	1805.0505

no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	346.9517
but what are you doing	380.5222
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to ali he whispered  remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you  ali bowed in token of strict obedience	681.4639

my first impressions were favorable to the minister i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved  dartagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim	467.2393
as was his custom dartagnan presented himself at miladys at about nine oclock	949.4158

i am m mordaunt  ah thought dartagnan the man i am warned against by athos  ah thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle  they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition	569.6614
he turned it gently on its hinges	2082.3066
at the end of an instants observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw miladys carriage stop opposite to him	880.7762
yes replied m de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers	820.0848

but what are they to do	211.1351
ah good evening my dear m caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour  40156m    the abb busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied	846.8655
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties resounded	2209.3198
well did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward	2000.0802
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles	518.9555

and then said monte cristo this is not all  what is there more said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars	322.2379
cavalcanti said debray	790.2474
rely on me  dartagnan knew that although a gascon m de trville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his word	537.6812
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the chteau dif dants nevertheless determined to make for them	1398.0739
he took his army to the priests where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornets who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal  dartagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companionsas the breakfast at the priests could only be counted as half a repastin return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him	828.0723
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example	595.5861
he was no	192.9474
the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the kings name were powerless against this formidable multitudeseemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more when at the shout in the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms ill treated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards	2133.0212

the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure	501.2744
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart  the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine oclock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it	421.6430
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur  when you please said dartagnan	517.8619
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	740.6669
but dartagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it	310.0667
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them	456.9137
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	338.2697

scarcely had dartagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	989.4192
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu	750.2902
the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had witnessed	226.2744
we are so good and gentle to your eminence	441.4128
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them	1568.8939
he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin	490.9058
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur dherblay	1043.5649
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	1156.6851
porthos maintained a majestic silence	222.3779
were they then so necessary  they were indispensable  the major passed his hand across his brow	827.0798
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer	475.9888
he made a movement of surprise and said  father you are very young  men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly	515.9370
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think  i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz	411.3983
truly said monte cristo with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses do i not ali  the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly	684.2280
go and tell him the ring is his dartagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you  reflect athos  ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices	373.3235
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at half past two oclock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall	1136.1974
de saint mran said madame de villefort then this house belonged to m de saint mran before you bought it  it appears so replied monte cristo	827.8781
they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur darminges	749.7938
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	1645.3490
i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then  andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever	481.1458
as to dartagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black	402.0116
under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action	1811.3491
i entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor shall	1387.8206
oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly  jealousy indicates affection  true but i am not jealous  he is  of whomof debray  no of you  of me	1993.9459
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him	461.2430
where your life was spared for shame	1542.4170
planchet  planchet added grimaud planchet with a gorget indeed  ah gentlemen cried planchet so you are back again in paris	1138.7168
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance  which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists  that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to m dessessart and inform him of his promotion	693.9301
on the 1st morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things	704.0450
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it	713.5856
it was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king	401.9635
well well dandr said louis xviii blacas is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurpers conversion the minister of police bowed	1959.6237
then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist	784.2252
here i am my friends replied dartagnan not only free but in favor  tell us about it  this evening but for the moment let us separate  accordingly that same evening dartagnan repaired to the quarters of athos whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of spanish winean occupation which he religiously accomplished every night	436.0248
i would rather find it triply bolted  and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth	1458.5426
follow the culprits steps he first kills m de saint mran  oh doctor  i would swear to it what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the other cases villefort ceased to contend he only groaned	941.0379
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me	590.2682
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing dartagnan on the coach box of the royal coach	843.8748
there are hours which last a year	685.0323
dear benedetto said he i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend     chapter 82 the burglary  the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil accompanied by ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining	481.0109
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death  why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercds the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernandthe very person added caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dants faithful and attached friends  and was he not so asked the abb	413.5622
not yet replied porthos	783.5490
yes replied the stranger	439.7995
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question  what is it sir  you are fond of gardening  passionately  and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres  sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it  you live badly on your thousand francs  badly enough but yet i do live  yes but you have a wretchedly small garden  true the garden is not large  and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything  ah they are my scourges  tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphing  i should not see him  then what would happen  i could not repeat the signals  and then  not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined  how much  a hundred francs  the tenth of your incomethat would be fine work  ah said the man	325.3390
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	622.7047
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony  really said franz	687.0403
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak	744.1707
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	659.6357
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love  you alarm me cried franz	389.3503
come come said the young man a glass of wine father will revive you	460.3761
bonacieux blushed	737.3518
it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel	827.5118
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise	728.7477
here are the horses hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly	840.6507
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them	600.3077
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet	600.1062
splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots	1860.0416
the latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice	893.7797
to give your majestys reply to those who await it  stay marechal i will not appear to parley with rebels  madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return  anne of austrias eyes shot glances of fire	1448.0121
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber	903.6479
this precipitationthis unusual appointment	1030.8888
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia	1054.5609
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss	789.7272
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	732.7448
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people	529.5643
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know  and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts	443.5392
then dants departed for genoa	1130.2098
no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps  yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed	538.1808
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction	922.4164
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows	1909.8346
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks  m coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme	1426.3488
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon	1102.2416
dartagnan seemed iron	1058.8170
he called for me at seven oclock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box	503.7760
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied dartagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i dont remember which  wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill  the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose	773.8265
i will profit by the advice  and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me  nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	555.8574
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us	698.9423
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself  ah ah	365.0506
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg license as specified in paragraph 1e1	249.3902
flee alone  flee alone and leave you here	982.6384
is the deed of sale ready  yes count  have you brought it  here it is  very well and where is this house that i purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary	456.7014
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornlie	998.0517
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a well filled one my dear  madame uttered fresh sighs	848.2420
1f1	80.8740
what is your name in your turn if you please  dartagnan  to yours monsieur  and above all others cried dartagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal  the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of dartagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was convinced	474.2751
but having sinned myselfit may be more deeply than othersi never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses	1002.2883
very well said he	182.6658
i hate the englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills beer  would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort	2481.4631
come guitant come along and lets see if they keep watch at the quinze vingts as at the barriere des sergens  and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined dartagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort	1862.5942
dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martins babylonian pictures	396.9086
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing  what is that madame  money  mme	622.9159
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against six	659.3040
i married that woman when she was a young girl i married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family i gave her my wealth i gave her my name and one day i discovered that this woman was brandedthis woman was marked with a fleur de lis on her left shoulder  oh said milady raising herself i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me	427.5216
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple	820.9523
monte cristo smiled	1996.0968
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	1199.2942

as long as the procurators wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself	663.2929

i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season  although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity	482.9313
ugh	67.7142

as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	581.2098

does your excellency wish me to accompany him  no the coachman ali and baptistin will go  the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars	515.9589
there and elsewhere  the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity  madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	634.4738
we will escape and if we cannot escape we will talk you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love	329.7469
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment  what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance	402.7127
we will judge you in spite of your silence	448.2429
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself  come and sit down close to me said milady	415.7625
by eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos	241.0687
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger	832.0732
is it my equipment  yes and no replied mousqueton	653.5020
to london cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in london  that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to me  but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none  nor i said aramis	310.8040
ah	80.2550
then bring some wine said dartagnan	849.1072
milady passed her two arms round feltons neck and let herself slip out of the window	1216.1710
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life  well perhaps you are right said athos	466.1929
proceed said he to the host	120.8244

the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report	1481.7069
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably	1689.2810
he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo and sat by him	1355.3551
we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant  athos placed his two hands on dartagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile	1303.0668
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches	333.3358
ah	91.2793
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed	677.3703
there are several branches of the dartagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong  i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty  that is well	459.4106
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted  haydes arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands	956.1366
i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle  mademoiselle cried valentine mademoiselle	1170.7369
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la rserve	1845.3467
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine  and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	681.4058
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names	1135.7738
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans  oh may god keep me from it and you too said dartagnan	1046.3499
and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him	358.1947
the baron has just related a frightful story to me  milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	1069.3337
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire	1337.8549
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive  ah monsieur  and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage  ah monsieur  planchet began to weep	654.2428
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk	653.6831
there only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	1044.1069

ah pardieu trville	1510.1712
what is that line cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak	1901.0322
everything conspired to prove to dartagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened	2019.8602
i will not abandon buckingham thus	1621.9635
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time  but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	749.9714
m cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast	644.5388
as to your rank an annual income of 50000 livres will enable you to support it admirably	2077.6143
i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit  you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintancetwo of my good friends lord wilmore and the abb busoni	497.3326

mademoiselle eugnie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance	1118.6217

there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as hayde whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerfs face	431.6732
mark well what i say	341.9328
on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice	1713.5482
he is dead and no mistake about it  oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please  so be it said the englishman	727.4542
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man	1358.7781
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that dartagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queens letter and for which he had repaid m de wardes with such terrible coin	497.8294
in a moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her sons arm	684.8910
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal	887.8926

was he the man that stabbed you  yes said the executioner	278.2511
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good will	1096.9716
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino	864.2225
you are not joking are you  no on the honor of an officer there is the half pistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him	350.3452
that was a superb throw so i left off there  dartagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast	946.0806
because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation  another method of assassination said the general shrugging his shoulders	442.1461
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but  say on  but since you go out with hayde and sometimes even take her to the opera  well  i think i may venture to ask you this favor  you may venture to ask me anything  well then my dear count present me to your princess  i will do so but on two conditions  i accept them at once  the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview  very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not  the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers  i give you my oath that i will not  enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not	781.1379

bring hither that horse  friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road	792.5070
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	1173.4604
thou hast no confidence in me	1086.9033
i think so answered albert in a firm tone	776.5366
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well	449.6571
indeed i should expect misfortunes  m	1748.0925
the matter was arranged as dartagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions	463.2413
at what time you please sir replied franz	672.7511
take it quickly  thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove off	948.4702
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignitiesthe comte de la fere comte de bragelonne  and he has no children with all these titles  ah said porthos i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly  what athos	734.2733

when i am dead you will go and examine it  what said morrel you dead  yes must i not be prepared for everything dear friend	355.3798
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other	592.1412
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	692.8218

the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition	507.8988
tis not civil war that disunites us	769.5992
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	655.6172

she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened	1073.7985

only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercds as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	1198.3944
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape	814.3779
she ground her teeth she was of the color of ashes	613.1430
friend said he for athos this is too much for the comte de la fre it is too little	429.9907
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general  and who charges me with this monseigneur said dartagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me  what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus  of milady de winter replied dartagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence  monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished  she has been punished monseigneur  and who has punished her  we  she is in prison  she is dead  dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead	1091.3790
50195m    he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtiers room	702.9149
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them	639.2872
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good	655.8755
dartagnan thought this was the moment to interfere	365.4527
fine vengeance that on my faith  a cold sweat broke from dartagnans brow	1505.2629
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise  that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	829.9911
no i make you my lieutenant general said the king	331.4081
it is gods pleasure that things should be so  the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce	1745.2040
i shall perhaps have something to say to you and he went out	247.7478
will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied up  charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman	437.8508
we were once four valiant knightsfour hearts fondly united let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes	1509.6831
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain	730.7200
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi pelagians  but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head	1312.2728
how is that my friend  why thus it is replied dants	365.5892
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	777.1730
they both came immediately m morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet	651.8904
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us  oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was dartagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping  aramis shook his head	1257.9060
the reader hushed herself instantly	981.1260
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	1364.7560
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on dartagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face	576.3770
are you hungry continued he	594.3132
then dartagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly	317.5653
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristos name announced	620.4323
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so i alone am to blame for the indiscretion	408.5587
dartagnan appointed eight oclock at athoss residence	802.2249
was there nothing to fear	538.4457
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much  after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said  i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort	423.2779
thats very kind of him  here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man	222.5484
besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience	1630.1644
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing  it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	680.1625
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary	1407.1316
but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highnesss yataghan to pieces the bey yielded and agreed to forgive the hand and head but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis	1525.7592
there madame he said is monsieur gondy who hastens to obey your majestys summons  the queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded	1114.7400
diable said morcerf	695.5000
that will be sufficient  you think so  certainly  very well then  if they should hear of the separation  ah yes what could i say  that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family  by the corsinari  precisely	683.1268
the tutor followed them	1385.4656
send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny well have a supper here under your direction  hum said la ramee	782.8200
we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us	1655.3385
volume three  30009m    30011m      chapter 48 ideology  if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m de villefort had taken	441.3661
it was in fact mordaunt whom dartagnan had followed without knowing it	648.9055
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	946.7260
i will be with you directly  the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	613.4465
my dear m lucien said madame danglars through the door you are always complaining that eugnie will not address a word to you  madame said lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed i am not the only one who makes similar complaints i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed  true said madame danglars yet i think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study  my study  at least that of the minister  why so  to ask for an engagement at the opera	756.4626
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	261.2196
is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris  nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said dartagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome his father who is coming in his turn  long live de beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass	427.8504
as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fte she was received by the city officials and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy	414.4553
now we are alone dear aramis said dartagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchets horse  ifaith answered aramis as you see from heaven  from heaven replied dartagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there  my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which dartagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same  here then is a puzzle for the learned observed dartagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near	603.3862
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him	653.1531
the latter smiled	1350.2298
listen for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream	1027.2905
the abb scarron	1288.9985
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents	533.8664
and aramis said the duchess quickly	724.8099
yes sir  a whole bottle if you will drink my health  willingly answered the soldier	1112.1570
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself monsieur dartagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an obolus for your life  i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence	678.4056
and signed by whomby the king and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt	1167.1919
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham	580.7874
23 germain pillon was a famous french sculptor 1535 1598	264.3390
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressing gown	1221.5099
your excellencies permit it asked the host	1707.1868
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	310.7449
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me  but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the queen	431.2303
thats it	118.1920
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	931.0183
why thou art posted here by heaven  no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses  is aramis here  yes sir he has been here since yesterday  what are you doing  on the watch  what	1044.5657
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said	525.2291
i once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am i  monte cristo approached her and silently took her hand	989.0828
low born fellows ejaculated porthos	1229.8634

and the guardsman  dartagnan  still my young scapegrace	1245.7891
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering  40280m    i said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	590.1357
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastrets warehouse and at smyrna from pascals that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars  now i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me  there you see exclaimed danglars	2130.3174
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england	793.0102
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps	505.8811
the other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp	649.8138
a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain	413.9046
when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those fellows there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword sound trumpets he cried  well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you raoul  i know not sir but i thought it really very fine and grand  were you afraid raoul asked the count	583.8253
sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all  but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	597.6090
and if you were mistaken doctorif it were not my daughterif i should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my childholdif that should happen although i am a christian m davrigny i should kill myself  well said the doctor after a moments silence i will wait  villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words	1236.1484
in that case i can give you proofs  no sir said dartagnan and we place ourselves at your orders  well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal	568.2767
but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	681.7314
thus the day passed away	464.2069
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet  how my friend planchet	1293.9741
he asked what was going on	363.4568
why should that man give me a false diamond  0349m    to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead  caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea	1137.1226
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues	1600.9915
it is over aramis had said	267.4845
chapter lv	564.7610
if he stays in we will break in the window	668.5644
what is this gentlemans name asked the commissary	1040.9204
and why  your excellency will know when you have read the letter  shall i find you here then  certainly  franz entered the hotel	517.5857
they fire like grooms said porthos	1504.1479
and a large sum said mazarin	873.4409
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it  i  yes you	657.9495
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	547.0262
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day i presume  that is the night my lord i answered	472.4358
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	487.5757
the kings musketeers are arrested by the guards of the cardinal are they continued m de trville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors	558.7388
madame de villefort fell at her husbands feet	1363.0254
this mystery required an explanation at least so dartagnan declared to himself	1321.4323
from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow	768.4052
who is this groslow asked porthos	588.7307
shall i see you again soon  next week i hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and i will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much deranged  very well i shall expect you	732.5848
my own service said dartagnan	679.8139
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt	1643.2894
everyone obeyed	1478.3503
i thought i had told you a most lamentable story and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart	363.9096
the soubrette said for your master i have no other master but you soa pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette  dartagnan opened the letter and read these words  a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest	1078.1461
then when they had disappeared he said with a smiletis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail	579.3073
if you were to die i should die too  the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips	473.6118
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service	1890.5299
gracious heaven exclaimed he	846.7221
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer	788.2085
what undertaking can have brought him to paris	872.6465
they led me away masked	159.4708
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess	606.6062
i obey my captains orders	384.5360
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied	408.5293
when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom  nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like  that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen	1479.9149
if i once went up those stairs	992.2739
the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before	664.1528
read me her letter  oh my lord said laporte	630.5923
thou again	1151.1418
and with whom  with whom can it be if not the duke of  the duke of  yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice	202.6124
he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there	986.0258
it is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a woman then all at once starting she cried my god	525.8162
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering  i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources  however  my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence  the abb once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m de villefort	510.2832
dartagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	821.7967
28 gaspard puget the sculptor architect was born at marseilles in 1615	533.8977
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly	404.0529
oh if you refuse my advice  what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing	799.7205
oh yes yes this instant i entreat you  in a moment that part of the floor on which dants was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	372.8568
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place	719.6863
it was warm work  we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him	619.3641
patrick let no one enter	1077.9344
yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt	811.4730
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found  monsieur mouston said dartagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to  then taking porthos aside  my dear du vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for i am going to take you to the cardinals  gracious me	867.7325
avenged yourself said the baron	415.4613
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now	474.4101
while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner  but the ink said dants of what did you make your ink  there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison	1192.3945
then he had a moments hesitation	802.1365
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries	252.0349
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	689.7010
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week	797.4658
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage door	466.1618
take it and there ends the matter  what cried athos are you selling my horsemy bajazet	1230.5555
at one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by lord leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword	945.4890
all fell to their knees	854.9788
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty	1453.8132
athos made him a sign to come with them	262.8323
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part	564.4206
no replied athos and he  oh he	213.7772
if it was mme	322.8505
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison	832.7427
welcome to ye  thanks my lord	1308.1444
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner  the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken	776.5811
no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately	523.6990
the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping	1696.1436
your very grateful milady clarik   thats all very simple said dartagnan i expected this letter	1264.1173
i know the french as well as if i had made them myself	344.8645
arrived at the staircase it was still worse	443.5959
creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors	1594.1644
my dear monsieur de rochefort	1046.2854
draw if you please and instantly  not so if you please my good friendnot here at least	727.1961
athos took her hand and kissed it	547.2560
my god said she what a senseless fanatic	1388.0594
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	652.7957
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	70.8632
dartagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de trvilles place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey  well i am in a maze said porthos do you approve of what dartagnan has done  parbleu indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it  and now gentlemen said dartagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for allthat is our motto is it not  and yet said porthos	396.8361
if he lays his hand on the boats edge i will cut it off regicide that he is  and i said porthos	654.7628
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded	800.0069
30  yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it  possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior	772.2355
now continued faria addressing dants with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	879.2510
you cannot go wrongthe road is bordered by trees on both sides  goodall right said a voice almost lost in the distance	1930.8394
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal  0341m    i understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all  yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	1568.5049
parliament indeed cried athos	884.3801
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de mdicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik  that is just said richelieu	940.5453
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful	1647.0321
i fancy i hear horses feet  impossible returned dartagnan	1766.1650
athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee	781.5284
tis true he said but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask  trousers said grimaud still squaring his accounts	748.0293
mme	59.6492
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter	795.9041
1e9	98.9274
grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety	484.8265
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host	599.7426
the place royalebe it so replied athos	1150.3511
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted	521.9012
linen and wine are both being warmed come  the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	745.8403
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	399.2224

as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her anger	539.8796
sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure	882.8796

a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly dartagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	1094.2225
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement	997.5136
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	1339.2128
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept	638.3223
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe	2252.3091
you may see matters differently dartagnan and think otherwise	2079.0464
count added mercds with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof  i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another  but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not  the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	1422.1403
i say i am entirely of porthoss opinion replied aramis	902.0164

here it is answered the other	208.2951
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	847.6763
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	362.3426

meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here	2082.0444
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol	420.8747
now he said are you in pain  yes my head is not only swimming but burning  whats the matter with this head said dartagnan raising the battered hat	585.8043
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs  a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings	1884.8607
answer frankly  i	1534.4604
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in dartagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected	560.3111
porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches	2335.6953
i believe the storm is over said he	361.5840
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears	908.7516
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark	767.4707
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else  athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent	906.4194
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed  then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night  and even for all day to morrow if you want it	400.0857

all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science	484.6545
edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps	735.0598
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody	2308.3691
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal	370.4815
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest	623.1565
athos was right	352.9948
and now said la ramee i must ask your highnesss pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure  the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimauds eyes	829.0063
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	765.1387
at the sight of the little letter the heart of dartagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	351.0927
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	620.5699
rinse the glasses said grimaud	775.7162
all he possessed was 15257 francs	2354.0212
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful	2081.3557
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out	1154.0768
then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	1569.1244
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	1428.9956
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared	434.2999
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me	1006.2172
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head	953.2981
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse	801.1548
tomorrow you will go	243.3989

you know bragelonne said athos i never speak without reflection  well comte i am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the prince de marsillac who is happily in paris just now	1013.8234
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbs in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet	1136.6483
at the letter s the old man stopped her	593.5089
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind	1266.5815
that is whether you really love me  i have given you proof of that it seems to me  and i am yours body and soul  thanks my brave lover but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of yours	261.4125
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face	578.9822
under that pretense you run against me	879.9078
i am lord de winter brother in law of that woman  the three friends uttered a cry of surprise	541.5565
in which the plot thickens   his visit to m de trville being paid the pensive dartagnan took the longest way homeward	1031.8921
come gentlemen your swords said the duke	570.3197
meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the louvre	661.6866
delightful	21.6565
in two days and by using up two or three horses thats nothing i have plenty of money i am at bthune	1454.4581
let us see what porthos has found for supper and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were	808.0081

the pavilion   at nine oclock dartagnan was at the htel des gardes he found planchet all ready	1183.6880
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection	1126.7831
yes said milady lord de winter and now you can understand it all can you not	352.9840
i confess it openly	768.4629
the chevalier murmured charles	1123.5151
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	574.9642
but i must see him instantly  take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother  you have kept the secret	604.8498
ah  bonacieux inferred from this ah that the affair grew more and more intricate	1283.9613
that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproachthe watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with concini and if i gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then	974.9629
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden	297.6110
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it	1479.7080
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might  mercds was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond	998.0855
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand	746.3857
a man  the discussion is going to begin again said mme	568.0914
now go he made a sign to cocles who went first the seamen followed him and emmanuel brought up the rear	561.8364
dants noticed that the captain of la jeune amlie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so	1530.3291
dants had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now	458.7504
come gentlemen let us all propose some place	1379.2994
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable	459.8511
oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two months	815.2780
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips	895.6398
the counts eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel	885.0107
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery	691.7969
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore	1171.3679
he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert	811.1832
i cannot resist doing so he must live  zounds replied dartagnan why dont you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch	1400.0292
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint mran arose from her pillow	961.9374
it was for this i had annulled the leaseit was for this i had comeit was for this i was waiting	381.8418
dants was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead	673.5333
what else can a strapping chap of twenty one mean with a fine wench of seventeen  and you say that dants has gone to the catalans  he went before i came down  let us go the same way we will stop at la rserve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news  come along said caderousse but you pay the score  of course replied danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses	1214.4296

we have our clothes some more splendid than othersthis is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it	1316.3477

the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic artone of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass	1482.3529

what	63.1100
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookerythat is the worst in the world	1381.8478

like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures	571.3064
i tell you so by the faith of de trville  how so  you will be assassinated  and i shall die in the performance of my duty  but your mission will not be accomplished  that is true replied dartagnan	342.0566
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father  see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses  indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent	274.8351
dartagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms sake	739.1216
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do  well it is true said anne of austria and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully	373.1982
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friendyou can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction	306.1173
are you sure of it  certain replied grimaud	455.5449
beat the messenger cried porthos	531.5883
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands  planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon	530.7687
listen then  ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them  listen continued the abb	853.8792
the real reason madame i can assure you i know my father  but i want to know in what way m dpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person  i believe i know m franz dpinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron dpinay by charles x  the same said villefort	480.6331
search among your friends your oldest friends  what do you mean monsieur  nothing else than i saysearch  alas i look around me in vain	1246.3643
and with whom  lord who can say monsieur	550.1368
really porthos you are a gifted individual  i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting itof killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera	1101.0958
what can you expect athos	746.6167
the interior of the musketeers   when dartagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress	337.1206
am i to put this construction on your visit  yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny  wait a momentno threats if you please m fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends	1121.0824
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you	1133.6836
is he at liberty asked the queen	376.7542
mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saint mran took and madame de saint mran is dead	1172.0830
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right  rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued	2010.4414
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	355.6315
at this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage	934.4447
but for heavens sake resumed aramis	2210.7244
to know what  the name of the owner of the winning horse  excessively only imaginebut do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no  i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not	1180.6447
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally  i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve  you serve the cardinal  yes madame and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart	638.8883
why what ails you asked he of edmond	528.6387
this arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever	766.3254
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair	1817.3315
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	1694.7004
the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her	1112.8091
dartagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	1534.7473
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken	447.3608
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation  albert turned	587.6539
tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there  are you sure of it  he has invited me to dine there  theres a life for you said caderousse a town house and a country house  that is what it is to be rich  and shall you dine there  probably  when you dine there do you sleep there  if i like i am at home there  caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart	344.4282
no you do not know me i have done all in my power to oppose it  ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend alberts account  on my account said the young man oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended	324.0161
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty	469.3329
i forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me  to the cardinal  what does he want with me  i do not know	458.3487
however that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him	767.7415
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table	475.9486
come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the door	436.0599
at two oclock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the htel of monsieur de trville	346.0933
if they ask it what have i to say  that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	339.1721
i have taught you how to handle a sword you have thews of iron a wrist of steel	933.7285
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her	732.5488
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants  the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day	456.5302
monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine planchet from head to foot	453.4587
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	1028.3687
my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg  good the luxembourg one might believe this is an allusion to the queen mother	955.4502
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	402.3342
do you call him nebuchadnezzar said mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is charles the first the king the good king charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself  charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him	432.8217
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance	666.7494
alas	92.9354
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercds and his father could have joined him	1416.1932
you are not hurt asked dartagnan	844.0378
but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber  but tell me said beauchamp what is life	472.2788
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars  villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room	514.6070
the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela	1535.7269
by the way said m de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here  no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background  bah you are wrong	401.0539
if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it	634.7882
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	1450.0795
you are now sanguinary but take care	1844.7018
yes  shall i call him  yes  valentine went to the door and called barrois	431.9294
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtiers breathing came thick and short	987.1143
during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from valentines room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child	730.1673
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that  i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity  do not run down m danglars speeches said debray he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition  pardieu that is exactly the worst of all	1016.8658
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat	1119.7094
the king	829.1573
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of arstein  eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon m lafitte	721.5721
athos	87.9893
breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious  you think the count will be angry with me  think it	339.0057
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared	1667.3075
you are there sir he said respectfully	499.3279
do you know monsieur dartagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen	616.9224
i have since learned that he was confined in the chteau dif and i should like to learn some particulars of his death  what was his name  the abb faria  oh i recollect him perfectly cried m de boville he was crazy  so they said  oh he was decidedly  very possibly but what sort of madness was it  he pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him  poor deviland he is dead  yes sir five or six months ago last february  you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well  i recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular incident  may i ask what that was said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance	647.0182
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance	735.5345
oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven	551.4725
do think of it giulio	771.2343
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you  oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear	487.7484
picture to yourself a pretty coach house at the right hand side where the ladders are kept	857.7961
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved  everything shall be done as you say athos	761.4437
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	665.5684
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again	624.5988
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility	640.7182
come athos said dartagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the gascon	360.9964
you have some in the house have you not  yes  send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic  villefort immediately despatched a messenger	1020.2389
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	1195.1188
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights	1967.9698
i shall ask him  just the very way not to know	358.5729
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved	1385.7983
gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult	653.3179
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	686.5333
what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth	907.1462
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding  20261m    monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart	687.5513
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	1283.7177
yes we are young yes we shall yet have happy days	679.2358
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house	2377.2334
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels  your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	936.1261
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	797.4948
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then i felt that i was lost  felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body	639.7248
monsieur dartagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity	543.0427
27 in the rue du helder on the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning and your word of honor passed for your punctuality  the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning rue du helder no	509.0042
and the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen	1345.7877
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life	1389.3859
let me see have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape	984.4487
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume	546.8653
the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst dartagnan and porthos stepped backward	849.5604
all these women had been or were beautiful	737.3053
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand	864.2984
and when is the wedding to be he asked	255.8871
you are stupid replied the cardinal	584.4467
tis settled replied dartagnan	1304.6204
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse	1141.3810
he became curious to solve the problem	976.6950
will that do  yes  what are you looking at  i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that	416.1983
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing	357.2436
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself	427.4291
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death  and ii swear to you before god madame said dartagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone  then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine	573.1203
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory  oh murmured valentine	418.2668
some of the men moved toward them	476.2719
grimaud begins his functions	409.1545
have you wanted money father  i want nothing now that i have you said the old man	334.5080
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass	474.9796
will you go away from here demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry	1324.4325
he was a berrichon thirty five or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent	210.5964
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds  ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies	813.7041
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii	1776.0570
where is my son asked villefort let him be removed from the house that he may not see  master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet	510.1691
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain	2472.5364
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men  madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful	1164.3180
chapter 29 the house of morrel  son  anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change	1214.0787
i will warn them  what the devil are you going to do cried dartagnan you will be shot  but athos heeded not his advice	387.1561
gramercy	56.8469
dartagnan approached her with his usual gallantry	1069.4093
they belong to the regiment that was at lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal  ah monsieur said dartagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our liberty  i wish it with all my heart said comminges	409.8180
arras was encumbered with fugitives	1292.7918
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it	419.6564
the abb busoni said la carconte	569.7264
go he said go my child edward ran out	831.7086
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above	701.2386
whence have you these ideas of death  you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your sonchallenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victoryyou do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live	527.5458
it was evident that the abb limited himself to objects of strict necessity	958.0140
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties  how is it all the better  yes for his eminence will give you all that you wantland money and titles  ah	222.7385
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them	696.9977
yes his mother  but does he know this secret then  i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession  unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope  i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges  thus speaking he fell back exhausted	522.8998
the four friends followed ten paces behind him	1694.7472
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates  on your honor is that true cried albert	970.1627
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont neuf	544.7460
as usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the chteau dif got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island	627.7978
in all probability this time his master would not retract	947.1984
dartagnan did the same	223.5125
m morrel had not readily given up the fight	895.6539
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	832.3093
by the light of one of these torches dartagnan perceived men in uniform	566.8896
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened	1194.8175
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die  oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my punishment  the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the chteau dif	507.5151
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere	1740.3667
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon	676.5633
one of our clients is a horsedealer he owes money to the office and is backward in his pay	794.5538
ah said dartagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	902.4083
besides you will strike at the throat porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry  very good said porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting  horrible horrible exclaimed athos	1125.8496
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	580.9962
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced  by the countesss visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone  you were with her then  i was  and what did you say to her  oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument  upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead	1237.1674
first madame who are you  who am i	219.2319
chapter lix	1177.3470
this last reason appeared convincing	1572.7186
is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die  he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward  athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	477.0363
the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably	1703.6664
and why  ah very well said dartagnan i see that you understand french	446.4281
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might  you are perfectly right my lord  you think so	553.1800
yes yes replied dants eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me  that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abb	454.1410
dants your health  fernand rose impatiently	1435.5494
but to you at least m debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known	684.1050
no time was to be lost	242.5460
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once	986.4297
i am afraid he has turned out ill she added	973.7694
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre	598.1085
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours  my lord said dartagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i cannot miss  do not be uneasy said mazarin it is the same  good thought dartagnan i fancied it was so  return then at five oclock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you	418.7465
no said dartagnan no i confess it	365.2358
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch	345.5440
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them	664.8670
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened  and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence	828.5479
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	728.1263
this operation proved as great a success as the first	877.6889
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol	1051.5205
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis	793.2182
he then motioned to his wife to take leave	591.3444
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired	517.4199
he wants to be sure that i go away said dartagnan to himself	348.7480
have you kept him in the cellar all this time  merciful heaven	604.9130
have you seen him	245.2338
the carriage rolled rapidly onward	669.7072
plague ont i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal  this arrangement pleased every one	795.1272
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	326.3167
are these persons then so rich and powerful  do you not know their history  i do not	546.5835
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young mans frame	1564.3684
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rocheforts servant	233.6015
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while dartagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table	700.1705
her very self she gave it me last night	848.0252
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased	480.0080
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger	429.7191

m dpinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations  however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort  ah that would be a great pity said villefort	488.8381
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man	602.3200

you know what athos told you the other day you eat at everybodys mess	1147.7977
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	511.0510
what next asked albert	1553.7244
but dartagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos	687.0272

having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across	532.2551
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	1130.5138
i will arm him against love  alas madame exclaimed athos to day love is like warthe breastplate is becoming useless  raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day	1909.5449
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her  trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	716.8966
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg electronic works in your possession	1328.1531
but why has he waited till now	929.3759
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description  then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee	1061.1982
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven	815.8183
that can only be to hold gloves he said	498.3824
meantime he was going to try to find out milady	366.6604
the king signed the order for release and trville carried it away without delay	2477.2744
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tablethe rarest of all luxuries in their complete formare well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers	1304.3448
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians  my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24000 livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country  talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy	981.0573
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed  good evening maximilian you are punctual thank you  ah is it you count said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristos hand with both his own	542.2932
keep back my lord said dartagnan	425.5344
do not fear pardieu we are alone  i think i have discovered my father  your true father  yes  not old cavalcanti  no for he has gone again the true one as you say  and that father is  well caderousse it is monte cristo  bah  yes you understand that explains all	625.1249
dartagnan took possession of his command	715.1222
i will ask the cardinal  it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fte  yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that  it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs  that is to say madame  it was he sire it was he  well and what does it signify whether it was he or i	307.4243
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal	548.8766
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all	891.3010
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of svres	803.7277
on saturday at six oclock	2193.0959
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions	861.7235
speak madame resumed mme	2186.3340
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high	469.8387
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	777.1730
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death  grimaud hesitated	435.8860
maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated itmaximilianhas he then owned all to you  everything	813.1572
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris	421.6066
thats love or i dont know what love is  come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but  yes said caderousse but how  my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so	377.6497
i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were i open them again and i see what you are nowa hundred times more beautiful  what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances  and upon what then must i live	274.6693
if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass valentinevalentineyou would have been doomed  but exclaimed the young girl why am i thus pursued  whyare you so kindso goodso unsuspicious of ill that you cannot understand valentine  no i have never injured her  but you are rich valentine you have 200000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200000 livres  how so	1200.2833
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses	532.5281
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand	462.4291
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abb perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine	1128.0411
five minutes after the door keeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety	653.1372
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating  we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously	1462.6517
the man made no reply	780.7571
yes why  because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyones neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessels bottom and then they leave her	924.7029
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with	1229.2759
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes	484.7726
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace	1561.4880
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	1818.8652
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams	1018.3409
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room	750.4251
with the first light dants resumed his search	797.1381
i might as well say count benedetto	1006.5551
dartagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away	1060.4102
then with a sigh poor hayde murmured he	937.4984
tell me i entreat  but my orders  your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour	728.9139
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters	1760.1168
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me  it is but christian charity replied dartagnan not to lead ones neighbors into temptation  it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them  dartagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute italian	542.7219
well cried his auditors at the moment you left his house  aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat	699.3730
but thats more than dislike thats ingratitude	280.2375
another gasconade murmured the gentleman	1371.6382
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill  the monster was himself	457.0737
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling	2459.9907
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	299.2568
monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	552.2141
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach	497.3042
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction  there was a stream close by and a bridge across it	773.0918
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me  fortune has been kind to you then	654.1075
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myselffor i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglersbut for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend	1927.1379
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed	780.0817
the same as yesterday  another nod on the part of grimaud	782.5551
never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers neck	87.3150
and what friends awaited him without	837.4036
oh now i may say so  so much the better replied monte cristo as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you	424.1853
everything lies in the execution  good the execution of plots is my forte  i know it well	421.9233
have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen  since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state  that may be my lord but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i cannot accept your offer  this then is what you call devotion	270.7236
and they walked on again	940.2893
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him  oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed rene it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues  why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for dont you see rene the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale  i dont know anything about that replied rene but m de villefort you have promised mehave you notalways to show mercy to those i plead for  make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts  my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand	788.0491
the people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd	654.3710
at the door he stopped to listen	281.1879
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fre  all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	715.3395
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily	1337.9821
indeed m beauchamp it is quite laughable  yet replied beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands  m	858.8359
wild dreams had disturbed his repose	2442.7703
no monsieur jester replied dartagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living  which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god  amen said dartagnan getting into his saddle	991.1399
is it you baron said he	195.7198
but there is nothing which would donothing  40114m    oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help	1050.4882
it came from my brother the king of spain	455.5302
hullo said albert it is monte cristo and his greek  the strangers were indeed no other than the count and hayde	363.6629
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow	1094.0640
well she said at length do you not answer me  i have but one question to ask youwhat do you intend to do  i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart	396.4189
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic  and what do you know of him  nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse  what makes you think so  on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday i said this mass again  and his name  maillard but i do not think it is his right one  and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post  certainly  let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true treasure  gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate	314.4563
the rest of the dinner was to come	241.4972
you suit me very well  baptistin bowed low	2258.8411
psdo pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house	550.9277
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion  but a humpbacked general	894.9742
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen  no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily i am not the queen	308.8958
on being left alone with mme	977.2665
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him	749.7408
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth	418.3374
how many rounds do they make a night asked dartagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket	1014.1313
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily	971.9088
sheathe then if you please and follow us  monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossiblemonsieur de trville has forbidden it	967.6014
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason	869.1653
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject	396.8900
oh i cannot tell what she says to me	446.4045
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother  but you may have excited jealousy	442.7480
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor	1725.6287
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican bandits  and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers  alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another	1115.0287
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said	408.5250
in the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless peoples minds were uneasy	1147.6136
dartagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains	884.4533
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti	1514.7990
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else  the devil	419.0272
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you	710.2836
constancy and discretion  well asked he when franz had finished what do you think of that  i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance  i think so also replied albert and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of braccianos ball  franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker	339.2304
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened  the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner  you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	472.0775
no misfortune has happened to the queen cried buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the question	548.2661
pass on your way then it is the best thing to do  this raillery exasperated jussac	746.8428
gondy bowed respectfully	1498.7944
your husband then is at last dead  how does that concern you replied the swiss	780.4742
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolenceswhich even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastropheswere seen to be utterly futile	1307.2906
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum	2256.8589
rage supplanted religious fervor	1231.6390
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army	863.7286
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost madwhat will not reality do  but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you  which asked the young man	1166.8490
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored  withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons  you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver	688.3730
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockworkan ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles	630.7811
well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow  hush said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of mordauntit will bring bad luck and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis	1460.3102
you whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by henrietta whatever news you bring speak out  sire cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle  ah exclaimed the king to fight  no sire but to buy your majesty  what did you say  i said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army  for unpaid wages yes i know it	1811.6895
we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838  in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders  they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue  come come that is not bad said lucien	991.8718
dartagnan took charge of it	526.4831
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets	687.7397
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell monsieur de trville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him	551.6435
then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face	1837.6923
ah good heaven	1710.6051
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure  porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice	563.9691
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the htel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him	867.6750
a waiter opened the door	999.8109
listen said she i yield to your protestations i yield to your assurances	675.0142
cheer up said she to noirtier	323.2180
go to go to	98.4817
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street	427.8340
but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true lightthat is to say with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris the viceroyalty of font de larche in other words of all normandy when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font madame de longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last	672.4820
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from herthis silver casket and these two letters	1684.9746
go  the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory	725.8232
i was most anxious to see you  but it must have vexed m morrel good worthy man said caderousse	577.5292
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry	1315.7233
for the present he had no anxiety	391.7002
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands  m	486.5584
it is no doubt the same said he	215.6955
alas sir i never had any opinions	1181.3547
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars	720.7812
i was there at a fearful moment	490.0685
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos	1166.1505
he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it	841.4146
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung  true replied grimaud	1593.9550
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker	1511.1961
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host	328.0371
come sit down and tell us all about this signor vampa  i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla  well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni  20101m    this replied signor pastrini that you will go out by one but i very much doubt your returning by the other  why asked franz	587.5942
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	2178.0493
the spaniards  that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	1088.0135
gendarmes said the president lead in the accused  at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter	791.8608
yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him  what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal	1232.4481
luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so i took advantage of his silence to walk off  have you seen dartagnan  we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again  oh said athos satirically i saw him	264.4463
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man	471.5175
you will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and dancing	896.8345
take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever	604.5511
in truth i was fated said she	960.2051
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner	1526.5138
i will run to monsieur de trville to tell them all this and will meet them there  very well monsieur said planchet	454.6376
the coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on account of my health then i have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with lafolloneyou know the man i meanthe friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be good lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what i have eaten  nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said dartagnan	2478.8247
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by dartagnan  all for one one for all  thats well	849.4008
at any rate tell me theres more chance of fighting in paris is there not  in that respect my dear friend its delightful	680.1317
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	478.1864
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the htel of m de trville	1182.9185
yesthat is a great word sir	418.6549
aramis shuddered	462.6095
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified dartagnan and i no doubt with them for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice	806.8129
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos	691.1069
an old acquaintance replied grimaud	2482.6680
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with it  but i have neither my women nor my servants  you shall have all madame	399.1463
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	544.5575
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us  but this fire continued franz	295.4067
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved  and if you wished to die you would choose this death count  yes  morrel extended his hand	935.8854
up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury	745.6469
at nine oclock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage	648.9998
cries of live the king	216.2359
the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates study	1579.1608
the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony	703.0604
well  one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant  art thou sure said the man in the cloak	477.4202
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell	625.6987
chapter lxxiii	1456.0587

all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	663.3688

dants seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible	1002.2418

i tell you what m franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now  and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert  well then hearken to me  i listen  you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question  i do  neither can we procure horses  true we have offered any sum but have failed  well now what do you say to a cart	957.6888
in their stead dartagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall	1259.6772
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound  ah hell come round thought dartagnan thats not bad  this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to dartagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics	497.2169

in england the post was well served	863.5639
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	301.5077
he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes	517.6832
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you  mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm  and you should call it devotion added aramis the vineyard of self sacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master  chevalier said dartagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting  oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois we havent known him so long  one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent	497.0583

the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	1606.9923
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	344.6720
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes  this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum	1284.2007

rather place faith in what i tell you	363.8409
two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them	1028.2765
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel dartagnan began to recover himself little by little	997.3885
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged	758.4401
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here asked planchet	2133.9429

one moment yes answered the queen	504.0237

what is the matter exclaimed dartagnan anxiously what has happened to you my lord  all is lost cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only ten  can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen  they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow	655.8711
i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also	372.2699
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	516.9407
the rumor of edmonds arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city	1986.3881
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases	610.7214
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit	627.3203
dartagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had notwhatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subjectbeen able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence	1736.2852
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love  the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks	645.8691
my lordwho told you that  nobody but i know it  i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria	793.3551

porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon	548.9636
chapter 19 the third attack  now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbs meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dants all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends and then dants countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies	1249.9459
my htel will be always open to you	503.3928

the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals	1283.7685
morrel said not a word	194.9033
i hold this serpent in my hands	945.3365
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit	2492.6917
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them	1215.3247
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible  do not think so brisemont said dartagnan do not think so	378.8387
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeera service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy	626.6877
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night  there now	555.8484
adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death	1363.4355
but his son came in	388.0179
ii was where dartagnan stands	973.1154
the president read  mr	1383.1059
you have not played for a long time dartagnan  and i have no inclination to play  swear to nothing	416.5980
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough	568.0012
i have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider	390.8192
why do you stop here asked dpinay	1027.2106
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game	961.8540
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be  what do you think aramis  why they are our men  you are not mistaken i recognize monsieur de flamarens  and i monsieur de chatillon  as to the cavalier in the brown cloak  it is the cardinal  in person  how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon  athos smiled but did not reply	470.3635
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment  ah	564.8718
you at last cried dartagnan	487.0254
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you  i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine  davrigny took the priests hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers	365.0882

any why not this evening  this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business  ah young man young man some flirtation or other	854.8027
is he prosperous and happy  he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon  a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head	1426.8556
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity  wasnt his name faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor	1448.5322
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow  be it so said beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours  well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately	504.2021
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances     epilogue   la rochelle deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year	1986.0216
m coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk	1093.9298
yes i have need of it  the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable	892.1000
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain	583.6360
m	57.8188
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood	1282.9802
and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent  milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes	621.4521
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder	1898.4161
silence said dartagnan pressing her hand still more warmly	1195.2823
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy	1070.5332
te deum for the victory of lens	1235.5963
well asked the president what is your decision  40206m    i have no reply to make said the count in a low tone	413.9874
i was uneasy about him  why  because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me	604.9834
what is the king doing they asked	333.4707
the youth brought a small loaf	1067.9014
miladys secret  chapter xxxviii	1283.3222
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	125.8171
is it you she said	129.7801
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full	355.6219
very good signor pastrini said franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days  as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage  what as to the carriage exclaimed albert	637.3790
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties	824.7413
do you intend opening the door said the baroness	462.1705
you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses  that is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our blood	973.7267
when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards it	752.8637
follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance	888.4283
with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs  ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths	928.8287
her son said he	314.5139
ah me	170.0452
if i were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do	417.4118
to prison with him	476.8327
a very respectable lady said aramis	1479.5331
do you wish to go to m danglars	271.2206
the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of it	841.5378
toward six oclock m de trville announced that it was time to go to the louvre but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the entre by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber	342.2547
yes replied beauchamp	1438.3359
suddenly dartagnan touched something warm which moved	253.3539
he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures	631.0842
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from tours  from tours cried aramis	771.6106
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty	544.8094
alberts love had not taken away his appetite	887.6886
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	737.5367
i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt	821.2800
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial	555.6995
sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger	1225.9674
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance	528.8739
hold out your hand and swear cried athos and aramis at once	426.2402
let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame	747.8694
the mandaa6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer	1274.6275
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	828.2350
project gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you charge for an ebook except by following the terms of the trademark license including paying royalties for use of the project gutenberg trademark	946.8596
but dartagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him	275.4353
what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it	326.9832
you are good and faithful servants  athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door	618.2588
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franzs imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina	1160.4281
a fleur de lis said athos	2077.3608
who are you and what do you want cried she	256.9260
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads	1289.5602
the several members of that group were much excited	1945.2538
three compartments divided the coffer	641.4307
dartagnan was the youngest of all these men	472.3197
this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo busoni	1677.4150
i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame de saint mran	320.1874
yes  shall i give these papers to m de villefort  no  to mademoiselle valentine  no  to m franz dpinay  yes  franz astonished advanced a step	597.7484
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days  as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	1569.0040
mazarin	68.4481
without me you would both have died	524.4922
ah yes it is indeed strange  and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	983.1066
you will not abandon me	637.7849
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord i merely await your commands  good it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain  liar thought dartagnan	1222.6146
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given	453.6648
the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore i will not speak more fully now	776.1205
chapter xxvii	705.2598
it was then three oclock in the morning	285.0008
just think	1237.5709
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine  no	1429.0869
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open dartagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid	506.6698
the deliberations had already begun	506.4964
no it will all go well m dpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible  i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m dpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation	681.0881
come in cried athos	276.6377
not the least in the world  oh you do quite right monsieur  but why this question  because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times  bah  preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guardi did not lose a movement of his features  and you found it  traitorous monsieur  indeed  still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction  it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us  monsieur jests but monsieur will see  what would you have planchet	453.2907
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	278.0159
soho cried athos	545.5810
come i am a good sort of a prince added he and although i like not puritans i do them justice and it is the same with puritanesses when they are pretty	402.5197
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamps confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence	1063.7435
my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed	1277.8917
and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to  so much the better	355.8434
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room	1034.7203
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately	232.7446
m dartagnan my dear m dartagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything  i will answer for nothing	534.6457
you have no enemy herethere is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend  and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand	920.8911
i will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly	1182.4559
this is where the mad abb was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed	330.3956
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	1347.0455
but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was herrera	515.6959
what art thou about	1311.8238
with forty five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six monthsyou with your music and i with my voicewe shall double our capital	1544.5175
i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it  and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs	560.4049
he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune  by your misfortune  yes  then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored  he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate  and that  he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me  what	697.4947
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn	744.1182
csar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but alexander vi	585.2094
all at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice	558.7391
in his eyes and to his conviction mme	378.2699
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object	1012.5069
he swam on still and already the terrible chteau had disappeared in the darkness	622.5602
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes  they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment	962.3416
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coinerssay  yes monsieur you are right said the host	603.5096
but to her great surprise dartagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos  yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better  when will you do that  immediately i hope  ah	603.2259
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders	677.5831

my lord has forgotten the supper  no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud  my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present  go on then have it your own way  come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say  grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	739.2806
indeed	96.9412
he is alone said grimaud	457.7123
there was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	643.5585
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything	944.2572
take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well  let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence	825.4747
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydes apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son  hayde said morrel what has become of her  she departed last night  to leave you  to wait for me	551.7279
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle making rings and plashing in the water	2065.8628

he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father  my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian  julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten	364.5188
holloa	26.0748
you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph  but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting  do not fear i have little to prepare  monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation	1008.0085
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival	871.2021
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion	366.7618
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide  prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron grasp	805.3493
will you permit a grandson of henry iv	1527.1202
if i did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the counts manners i would have taken you to the chamber there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators  i shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait  ah here is my mother cried the viscount	558.3814
ah there	517.0625
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friends arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queens service  yes its true	519.5956
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position	896.2495
monsieur de trville awaits monsieur dartagnan cried a servant throwing open the door of the cabinet	695.5839
i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will begin  porthos and aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword dartagnan turned to his adversary  sir i am waiting for you  and for my part gentlemen i admire you	586.8715
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	669.0437
as you please said athos	327.3878
dartagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it	979.4050
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again	494.0498
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom  the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel	553.7846
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher	884.0887
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare	818.4149
hold your peace porthos dont remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday	861.4820
the palace of the louvre contains two thingsthe king who must die and royalty which never dies	1665.4141
and who has seen this fleur de lis inquired aramis	1637.7393
it seems you must always be playing some game or other  yes and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take	552.3652
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir	534.6238
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of dartagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late dartagnan had already recognized mme	1048.3794
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him tete a tete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade	505.9996
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before  ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortunes  it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people	914.0959
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that  i am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of them	617.9440
what could put such an idea into your head  yourself  ahwhat next  most assuredly  i should like to know upon what occasion  oh mon dieu that is very easily done	1207.5886
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him	635.6266
you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy	426.4698
but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon dartagnan with sticks shovels and tongs	1133.1156
the young man remained immovable	891.1958
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over	411.4092
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine	710.2050
the cannonade of the isle of r presaged to him the dragonnades of the cvennes the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes	1531.9784
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries	922.5573
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post	860.5229
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	330.9073
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache	1130.7336
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her	911.1263
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrinis hotel	653.2923
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears	902.8499
but that is not a mans name that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his head	414.8986
i will make you all captains with good pensions	1048.3180
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped	271.0379
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	1613.8606
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest	893.7878
balls parties and ftes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera everywhere except in paris	1294.3259
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back	1407.2994
dartagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind	775.4428
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight  i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome  ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball  our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oclock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since  and dont you know where he is  not at all  is he armed  he is in masquerade  you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does  you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him  who can tell	333.7451
grimaud he cried remain i wish it  then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed he saluted and made a movement to depart	490.8820
they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers  brave young man murmured the king	433.4233
more than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own household	996.0867
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal	508.4411
now pass your arm through this opening  why  you will know presentlypass it  porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	1504.9277
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it	1285.8638
ah	31.3608
de svign	55.5013
this was the gist of his strange story  the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was empty	845.9150
bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille	952.0193
the blood had mounted to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis	330.4377
debray muttered albert	917.3031
my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought  eugnie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentines cheeks	564.7766
bonacieux at home   it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king	437.1123
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction	626.8865
it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans favor	568.9564
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerfs brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives  but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call	1267.6099
no replied athos fortunately monsieur dartagnan has only fainted  ah indeed so much the better said lord de winter	841.8127
here we are said athos	262.2994
hayde is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it  oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity	814.6253
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars	577.5820
i trust all this will soon be taken away  bertuccio bowed	1353.2091
come he said tis a warning from heaven	808.3872
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse  the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and dartagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him	640.2161
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living	667.9586
i wager anything said albert interrupting her that i know what you were about to say  well what is it  if i guess rightly will you confess it  yes  on your honor  on my honor  you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expected  not at all	512.3361
do you know the decision we have come to mother  have we come to any  yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercds sighed	354.3966
the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts approach	817.1121
hol bazin come here this minute  bazin appeared on the threshold dull and spiritless	2106.7708
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	564.8067
spanish policy and austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he richelieuthe french minister the national ministerwould be ruined	1015.0201
fatality he muttered	832.6761
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong	331.3619
then you are going with me  i will accompany you a portion of the way said athos	259.5300
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world  your valise is then empty asked porthos with simplicity	893.1526
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses	516.2234
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt	385.0485
i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again	1176.1769
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him  mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to dartagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said  sir	743.8527
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl	510.6059
well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint	774.5198
say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error  the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him	763.9189
these would just have suited them	1459.3530
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope youre preparing a pretty trial  why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for  and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume  i should think not indeed	1453.4070
one day you will be able to understand how all this is  well then to the king your nephew	368.3436
the presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard	987.7482
shall i help you madame asked athos	439.4186
but hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen	1142.1841
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of heramorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her	748.6363
baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him	318.3730
but at daybreak he awoke	2020.8101
a barrier had been placed between dants and his old friend	774.2184
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here  no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued  well said milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening	387.3793
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good  well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	315.7024
take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours  come come i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you	513.4207
i am a criminal as it appears	697.4827
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	393.3232
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned	1513.2937
no no exclaimed debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave	505.2917
he is then the same englishman whom i metatahyes indeed	946.5184
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	2411.7959
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising  that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood	1766.5298
upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog	967.4266
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events	744.0383
i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire  yes said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him i think he was your colleague  precisely answered bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another	673.8992
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more	417.7065
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission	346.4863
no no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone  the honorable the kings attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dants mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris	579.5474
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m morrel	769.5848
is there anyone in the lobby said the president	612.6298
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man  this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage	798.6055
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speakingbesides who says that it will begin again  it has returned count exclaimed morrel that is why i hastened to you  well what do you wish me to do	544.2670
what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in words	390.4185
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur crquy another time at my own house in the country in my chteau atwhen i had a chteau a third time at monsieur de trvilles where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it  then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman	721.1807
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe	417.4332
dartagnan a little recovered from his first surprise had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy	1340.7347
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed	945.0494
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting	487.6021
and who is the assassin they asked together	532.6583
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue	683.6537
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating	1448.7870
what are you doing asked he	324.4809
at this instant m de trville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	2336.7246
the devil it does said la ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord	486.2022
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for dartagnans embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i knowyou with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent kingyou my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as dartagnan  porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said  yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right  athos arose	516.3610
peace with the landlord in addition to athoss old horse cost six pistoles	1458.2498
in the first place you will sup with me will you not asked aramis	312.4653
besides the king i am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking anything  you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himselfmore than he hasobliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king	1040.8336
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival	1418.2437
bazin	51.1090
aha cried dartagnan theyre coming toward us  so much the worse for them said porthos	871.2695
chapter xxxv	677.5626
dartagnan here  himself  but thats impossible	1150.1405
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea  i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes	932.6908
oh i repeat it edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is sublime  do you say so now mercdsthen what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you	696.7427
reflect then wretched man and repent  no said caderousse no i will not repent	662.7226
nevertheless to dartagnans great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely	555.0153
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	405.6388
i have brought away ten or twelve wounded	1612.6029
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal  what	1021.9366
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass	450.4642
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fre the pleasure or the ennui he may experience	591.3963
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge  bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance	1540.2451
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy	1365.6719
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort	849.2833
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller	1126.1804
de villefort cried the king is the messengers name m de villefort  yes sire  and he comes from marseilles  in person  why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	560.8542
and that is a mousetrap	485.3424
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	2116.6660
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming red	1154.8385
our partnership began in the month of april	2087.0681
then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused	859.5288
now he said to teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be  oh yes exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically	515.8839
villefort continued  he knows me and i have pledged my word to him	386.6390
accept my compliments your dinner has been a real feast	1480.8967
a newly born infant repeated debray this affair becomes serious  well said chteau renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters	2480.5532
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed	615.3907
athos made no reply	995.4082
i shall be about again in a few days  why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris	540.0037
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it  my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your lookthe thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a womanwere grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered	372.6738
our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect	626.4379
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address	463.1712
really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease  indeed you give me more credit than i deserve i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all  when shall you send your invitations  this very day  well i will immediately call on m danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow	845.1555
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also  he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter	268.8248
i cannot tell you i dont know him  how	500.2344
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him	333.1968
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly	136.8691
the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people  thats right cried morrel	1134.8091
thats wisenot for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the masterfor the masters we may say	973.7054
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert	943.8871
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them	1247.0259
you must dress him up during my absence	1214.4025
it was evident he had his orders	354.7801
he would not sell his horse not for a kingdom	537.5018
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum  peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out	921.4959
athoss idea cried aramis and dartagnan at the same time	331.1857
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	534.2278
i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests	927.9667
anne of austria sought to read in mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired	986.2040
you will charge broussel to report it	1306.7877
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard	541.9489
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture	304.0903
well then let it be war	513.9020
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey	658.4868
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make	630.8091

well monsieur i am at your service  if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family  certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention	406.5786

charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn	437.2201

what is he waiting for asked another	430.2723
oh sir planchet only touched the tips of the counts fingers	1193.6399
dartagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist	1155.5520
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame	518.9434
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dants and so lay bare the motives of villeforts plot	959.0086
we have the gates  the gates	395.3606
my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability  morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	742.9056
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	1107.1502
ah sir replied caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me	573.7476
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimauds ear	867.4685
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room	651.3439
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony	1080.2180
i will give you three replied the stranger	420.3041
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself  dartagnan summoned anne of austrias servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queens presence	366.0860

the decanter and the glass were completely empty	1197.4617

he drew back terrified	482.5582
really said dartagnan these people are very ingenious	976.5445
you are too charming said dartagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love  no i use your generosity thats all	1099.0192
water  oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice	978.0768
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as dartagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas  yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now  oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time	469.7274
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel	1146.8551
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that  you admit that you would fight then	1808.2140
the cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence	822.9147
impossible  go on go on my dear fellow said dartagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference  we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each  you are laughing at me and want to try me said dartagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the iliad	359.7611
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dants the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmonds time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them	432.2026
has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth  if they knew anything they would not question people in this manner said dartagnan to himself	627.0847
what do you want  something to drink  your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome  then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow	1175.6061
i also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons  for a thousand pistoles  for a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too many  and you have them  they are here  upon my word i think he acted very generously  generously	463.9303
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100000 francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in parisamongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just nowit was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place	604.6595
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile  you are sagacious  i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me  you	615.4922
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him	413.5011
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo	429.7790
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	1056.3311
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled  has he eaten anything lately asked madame de villefort eluding her husbands question	540.3055
well she is a monster who at twenty five years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals	646.2751
help	48.8438
dartagnan therefore returned to the rue frou	836.8320
i dreamed that i saw you lying bleeding wounded  in the left side was it not and with a knife interrupted buckingham	490.3830
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it	521.4388
but what brings you here  his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you  i only arrived yesterday  and what have you been doing since yesterday  i have not lost my time  oh i dont doubt that  do you know whom i have encountered here  no  guess  how can i  that young woman whom the queen took out of prison  the mistress of that fellow dartagnan  yes madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted  well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other	456.1520
he remained listening and gazing	742.5869
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinire	760.6149
without having been in the school of the abb faria the worthy master of la jeune amlie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provenal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support	573.2867
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry	653.1055
see said she if everything does not second us	890.3990
i will go down  then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps  but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dants saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	869.8025
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant	575.2452
because she had been branded continued dartagnan	891.9017
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers	1289.5165
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him a guinea each per day and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed  you forget aramis one precaution of considerable importance  what is that  the precaution of changing our clothes  changing our clothes exclaimed porthos	495.2704
go on said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end  evening came the ordinary events took place	354.9092
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	1042.4296
come said dartagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey  where are we to go asked porthos	913.1719
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken  shall i send word to him as coming from you  yes certainly  shall i tell him that he can count on you  to the end  and you will leave the command to him  of the war yes but in politics  you must know it is not his element  he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own fashion  you care about it then so much  since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red  one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing	586.5537
see	68.1179
he shall go thither  and at his return you will send him to me	356.9094
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one	527.4454
buckingham had returned to london mme	648.3357
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties dartagnan would become the preserver of his friends	1149.4847
this league was directed against france	1106.1258
you here rochefort he said in a low voice	385.3817
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandr was irrevocably lost	1134.9514
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience	1109.6483
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green  oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republics which deputed david12 to devise a uniform for the academicians  indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician  within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly  and what is his especial talent  his talent	590.8889
dartagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon dartagnans sword	787.8643
dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	460.5382
she must have spoken she must have confessed everythinga woman is so weak	1695.0721
you want to know how we came here	608.1618
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	960.6700
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this  dartagnan is right said athos here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de trville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i dont know where	863.5515
the road as dartagnan had observed was the way to blois	488.8013
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul	831.1009
some sang ballads about mme	208.7672
she thinks of me then after five years of separation	969.1964
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and davrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayhe is mad  but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	488.0390
but what detains her	630.9748
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read	364.3889
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	546.9271
two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard	1823.3807
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m de trville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment	457.9563
those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people  and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence  that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one  why not  because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird  unfortunately that is true	1560.0903
do you not know the race said he	232.8644
coquenard	25.2862
m morrel and mercds came to see him but his door was closed and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer	289.4362
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	383.0892
to what country demanded porthos	1867.0724
soldiers are big children but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed  dartagnan could not restrain a smile	433.4950
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary  zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter  he opened a drawer and took out a purse	1365.3522
is it not a curious affair  so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character  not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them  beauchamp was thunderstruck	599.2149
i have during those five and twenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms  sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure	649.1205
what is to happen said porthos	317.8183
without a blush men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing	659.2537
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after the campaign  ah monseigneur  you accept it do you not  monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed air	719.7141
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback	803.4077
indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first rate paris tailorprobably blin or humann	842.8394
nanenino  yes yes yes said the old mans eye	628.1770
bonacieux retired	565.1057
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass	1091.6179
nothing is lost then  and now madame till i see you again	380.7485
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict	1728.4962
come come calm yourself my sweet girl	72.3607
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu	733.5944
morrel looked attentively on villefort	1390.7659
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628   felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand	1327.6775
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer	662.3435
adieu i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other  the abb with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming	1185.8716
he gave us some very fine horses  and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own	950.5628
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act	1278.1093
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them  reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe  buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	564.4402
nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves	375.1755
m	26.4183
when the gentleman who came three months agothe agent of thomson  frencharrives announce his arrival to me  cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself	1974.1863
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was	719.8130
well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it  go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you morrel  40260m    i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid	540.5307
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds  i think i have some clew  but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot  beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	1053.1473
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate	1853.3892
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life	386.7268
addresses to the duke of orleans and to cond were suggested	519.1815
but andrea drew a cigar case from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking	2101.4253
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven	951.1246
this was the departure of fernandof fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother	833.6923
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigis arm in a group of peasants	1809.7968
olivain we have come into possession of two horses but i have lost my own	450.7637
the fool	1291.5796
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse	356.1041
in recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man	620.6815
dartagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passers by and he restrained himself	934.9649
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of holland who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which charles i had made restitution to the united provinces	1071.8827
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key	500.5936
la houdiniere captain of the guards   the devil said athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other  i will go to the second after attending the first said dartagnan	808.5172
now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out  meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson  french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example  not at all  plainly enough messrs thomson  french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing  monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned  it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so  by what right sir  by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive  once more danglars bit his lips	747.0690
to the boat	307.5685
chapter lxxxiv	59.7596
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	775.5105
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air	639.8139
repudiated by her husband said athos	371.0319
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	369.7903
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders	632.6216
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it dartagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you	406.4906
there is everything in a jesuit convent  then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men  undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized  god pardon me said dartagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you  no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner but i have expected you to tell me  well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please prince though he is  hold on	842.8571
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	1314.0762

as to that said aramis we are witnesses	376.9707
in gods name answer me  he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	701.2169
i do not know you for one of us  then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat	246.2160
pass on replied the guard	289.5233
in fact of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	1071.1178
oh come gentlemen my master is ill  the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	917.7492
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette  go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here  sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty  on the contrary siron the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled	968.6198
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going  why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion  but what are we going to do there  you know well that we go to breakfast there  but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot  because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	337.6976

this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now representedbroken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughtsbut such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of r and lay siege to la rochelle	1951.1333
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior	603.5021
when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my stewardthus i do not waste a minute or a word	917.8311
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs duvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grtry and porpora	1108.5606
my life belongs to my cash	1671.3894
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	845.7573
this is frightful	1253.6909
the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away	572.6952
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i dont know who for my part  and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in a tremulous voice	912.1262
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	500.5403
her htel was remarkably sumptuous and while the most part of the english had quit or were about to quit france on account of the war milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence which proved that the general measure which drove the english from france did not affect her	857.7417
noirtier resumed m davrigny in the same pitiless tonem	837.3775
he had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent	868.7733
those must have been ten weary years  dants took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him	606.4283
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	616.7847
what have i to do with politics	275.7723
they are no longer sure  planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton	688.9290
he rose however as they approached	1278.2770
in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double locked carrying off the key  ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery  no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution  and was the sum a large one  it was not money  ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant  yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box	380.3138
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel long live the coadjutor  long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness	742.8142
ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician who would have suspected it	628.7635
where was i then	128.4503
i know nothing  can you not understand that monsieur dartagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence  truly  do you not perceive that i know allyour abduction from the little house at st germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this moment	648.8049
those who have read the memoirs of mme	517.5025
sell the crown diamonds	1709.0731
mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up	656.7700
i will embrace your knees	2045.6450
no i did not say i was a stranger to you	180.7670
it was about eleven oclock at night	875.7025
morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly	1151.9934
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me	988.8806
it must be done said athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	473.5269
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo	719.6771
but suggested dartagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos  yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably  here	796.0411
madame de saint mran has arrived and her husband is dead  m de saint mran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship still the death of one old man always considerably affects another	807.0893
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it	710.6125
he told me to watch you  and why so	297.2008
here we are said the gascon	251.4782
you tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to fail  she will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce herself  she is capable of anything or everything	270.3413
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes	1801.5664
is that your name monsieur  my very own	426.9520
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now  and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason  the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself  then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette	551.3902
have you seen my mother asked albert	569.4564
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors	837.9732
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me  come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story	1254.4589
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin long live broussel long live blancmesnil resounded through the city	793.5995
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man	249.8649
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you  sir	286.3706
you are right said the latter m	380.6327
dartagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence	603.5096
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open	519.0963
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously	678.6237
as for you you have acted like a barmaid	699.1540
what you do not know	227.9740
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries	1343.4065
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community	1697.2551
dartagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you  athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	481.2835
but presently the exempts face suddenly brightened	175.0858
i have served them without enthusiasmgod knows that i estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on principle	912.2023
poor lad	112.9787
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed	804.8870
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy	1364.9747
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue	925.8130
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me  milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it	1046.8164
the procureur  no  the doctor  yes  you wish to remain alone with m de villefort  yes  but can he understand you  yes  oh said villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him aloneoh be satisfied i can understand my father while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently	529.1122
five thousand francs per month	1063.7356
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	1082.2555
section 5 general information about project gutenberg electronic works   professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	398.4228
it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement	772.8610
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	202.3355
that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use i would make of it	552.5833
you would then be in present possession of the letter	328.7041
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him	775.0336
well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesi cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free  unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	1972.5791
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	1893.2417
my dear athos he said i am going away	381.2374
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another	484.0287
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort	2464.9893
dartagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished	925.1824
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale	1589.7146
your feet too said grimaud	1110.6949
i can just suit you  ah said porthos brightening thats well as regards my horse but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres  three hundred livres	939.7411
have we overtaken them  good	1642.7080
but continued dartagnan how did you escape  i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window	416.2241
how happy i am  at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up	793.9781
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m de trvilles htel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship havent i     chapter vi	312.3719
look at that wallwithout a single windowwhich tells you fine things about mazarins gratitude  yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur dartagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him  poor dartagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves	429.7651
if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenso much the better all would be over	733.3362
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom	754.5086
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman  perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine  and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger	530.3869
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things	1937.1055
ay and observeit just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the antichrist  well said milady	1425.3405
hey	54.2624
see the state in which he has put me  oh my lord cried the baron i shall never console myself  and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to him	509.7071
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said  milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	793.1089
you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy	756.1896
give me your arm and let us go  very well let us go said caderousse but i dont want your arm at all	515.8865
you have not deceived me	439.0358
my sister is happily married her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life	717.9516
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs	562.5344
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo  ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo  yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished	967.0484
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven	1040.7408
to what class of society does he belong  he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri he was born at pampinara and entered the counts service when he was five years old his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome	732.5890
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on	688.5749
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy dartagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him	898.7834
were her fears realized	277.5647
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them	766.3516
you do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again  ah you virtuous men said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin  the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword	1131.0061
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	792.5479
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve	1811.9642
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home	1370.6359
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	321.3044
lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars	1156.7812
the scotchman	109.2526
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst	733.5391
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	617.5457
you have received a regular letter of advice  yes said danglars but i confess i didnt quite comprehend its meaning  indeed  and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation  go on monsieur	1241.0044
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted	813.8860
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formedit was none of these things that attracted the attentionit was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdainthese were what fixed the attention of all upon him	1401.9432
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you  for monsieur de wardes said kitty	593.7888
boisgoli tell noirmont that i have two guests	1087.2397
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word	693.0294
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy  yes replied aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess	619.1081
do you refuse said mercds in a tremulous voice	796.2169
at what hour does the examination take place  at two oclock  send at twelve said danglars smiling	977.8235
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos	1427.6682
i like that	229.9196
you cannot be mistaken there is but one  afterward  you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word forward  which means  in french en avant	420.8871
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend	576.2852
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	959.7415
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties  it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	526.3817
tell him all about it baron  why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king these were his own words of that i am certain  well blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him	376.4010
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of ablard and hlose placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertakers men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial	1568.7084
give me therefore one more day before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality  if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate it will not be a house i shall see but a palace	459.3972
as to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever i escape from his hands	266.4432
i told you so athos said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	578.9342
two hours passed thus	2434.4272
let us go on	436.9416
come along	1426.6992
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes	1429.7180
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another  what is that  break his armwound himbut do not kill him  i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i  and you  that will be another thing i shall be brought home  no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings	679.4891
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni	1169.7542
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine	525.1439
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole	1321.9617
remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived	776.3441
besides kitty would not like to live in the rue aux ours	950.3616
do you know what they are saying here  no your eminence  well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he has not done so already  the officers face expressed complete stupefaction	555.6777
come back as ambassador come back as minister come back surrounded with guards who will defend you with servants who will watch over you and then i shall no longer fear for your days and i shall be happy in seeing you  oh is this true what you say  yes  oh then some pledge of your indulgence some object which came from you and may remind me that i have not been dreaming something you have worn and that i may wear in my turna ring a necklace a chain  will you departwill you depart if i give you that you demand  yes  this very instant  yes  you will leave france you will return to england  i will i swear to you  wait then wait  anne of austria re entered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with gold	1115.6105
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each	800.9409
dartagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	348.0303
he will answer you  the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor	1042.9357
the man in the mask	290.9144
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open	344.5695
mercds read  albertwhile showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy	1052.0302
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray	441.1799
edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale	1462.1608
hear me maximilian said his father	352.2846
we are first said morrel looking out of the window	371.4227
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and rene in waiting	768.4323
as to getting him drunk the duke couldnt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it	494.3563
dants eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed	649.4899
see my father see  villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father	425.7968
theres the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights  chancellor said the queen turning to seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences	1153.6959
i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me	810.2957
prove it danglars	397.6736
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat  but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner	536.9830
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank	1353.9624
and who are you  eh pardieu joannes the jeweller  well and you said i offended the good god said la carconte with a horrid smile	604.2396
the devil cried the host at his wits end	1116.5875
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the garteri said to myself my fortune is made	982.7789
the chaplain of the chteau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyres for a week	459.2939
no its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it	1046.1104
one might believe the queen was about to speak	365.9272
do you know of what he died asked davrigny placing his hand on noirtiers shoulder	849.2736
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of youa remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn	926.2607
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while dartagnan stood before him stupefied	836.0028
and the queen  what queen  madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv  she is at the louvre as you know  yes and i hear in bitter poverty	585.3291
this affair made a great noise	954.5226
what is it that we really desirethat which we cannot obtain	1053.2750
milady recoiled uttering a cry	1296.9472
officer cried grimaud	1316.7318

we shall be murdered there said aramis	776.0894
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers  what matters it if you avoid them  hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold	548.0536
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	353.9248
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	368.3996
ali returned a sign in the negative	543.9520
if so you can spare yourself the trouble  no said mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other  then what may it be  to call for monsieur le coadjuteur  the coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker	707.8802
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto  i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me  well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	451.1962

yes my lord it is i i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly  and dartagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking	339.3644
1f2	82.9150
it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count	455.9198
a horse he cried i have found a horse  and i likewise said athos	305.8182
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil	247.4535
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart	957.0178
louis de bourbon prince de cond who since the death of his father henri de bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period monsieur le prince was a young man not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old with the eye of an eagleagl occhi grifani as dante saysaquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldierthat is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage	2432.5730
27 rue du helder 21st may half past ten in the morning  now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself  shall i see you again ere my departure asked albert	1316.6133
a lover is never terrible he said	645.7052
it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head	791.3885
what do you mean grimaud he exclaimed	605.1827
i comprehend now  you comprehend said porthos	838.7136
monsieur dartagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least	679.7913
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength	982.1061
but therenow take himhe is your own for as long as you like	898.5983
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the morning	900.2593
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion  the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain	1275.8400
follow me said morrel i will take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours	363.3523
athos cried the two musketeers	346.4841
well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which i have put on some vine leaves to please you wicked one	1003.1206
see him and hear what he says  m	452.9088
their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when dead  yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome  true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could  the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything	2182.0984
well i can weather the stormi whom notwithstanding you tax with fearnot with bravado that is not my way but i am firm	1519.4021
i expected this said felton	830.5743
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man	464.6197
can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his friends	384.8961
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty  really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world  there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly	875.9112
lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomewhere	1354.2761
the idea was not that of a christian i knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my mind	627.9976
do not call anyonedo not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of  valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the counts marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girls mind	1010.1309
gracious heavens another idea presents itselfwhat if they should be  his hair stood on end	2234.9438
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry  and i am so still said porthos bowing to harrison	839.4401
but my dear count has m danglars any reason  ah	833.0497
dartagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or lookingindeed as if he had never seen them before	702.7018
the four countenances expressed four different feelings that of porthos tranquillity that of dartagnan hope that of aramis uneasiness that of athos carelessness	969.8065
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	695.4052
the young man burst into a laugh	830.4227
bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by terror	559.8892
at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count  you asked milady	668.2772
do you know that	159.9446
ah	28.5681
no cardinal said dartagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he  exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture	476.2185
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime	1686.5454
0215m    you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place	551.6732
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination	578.6651
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end  horrible ejaculated the priest	493.2974
from lord de winter repeated buckingham let him come in  felton entered	962.7827
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de trville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	586.4559
at bottom the character of m bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice	1889.1421
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence  ah really said monte cristo in a half stifled voice	897.0199
at the same time mercds reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore	1194.8202
spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste	622.4744
my friend	1003.4722
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist	359.6113
besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward paris	369.5231
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry	617.0480
and this carte blanche said dartagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands  no it passed into mine i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell a lie  my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life  then it was to go to her that you left us said aramis	1456.9626
so that thanks to her friends generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome	1198.5950
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	661.2711
i raised my head i was in utter darkness	698.7680
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend	529.2480
dants listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire	813.6572
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he	956.1434
athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	733.9411
and they pursued their road in mournful silence	1977.3236
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come  i have been advised of it  but the three millions  the three millions are probably on the road  then i shall really have them  oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money  andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment	439.5844
you held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards me	1273.6444
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence  and for the second time hayde stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips	684.0502
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weaponswhich were very beautifulif not with envy at least with curiosity	291.6497
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands	181.5740
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	341.2055
the officer obeyed	1543.6035
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage	489.4646
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand	663.5643
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire	1555.1074
there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off	1075.4967
alas said andrea sighing one cannot be completely happy in this world     chapter 65 a conjugal scene  at the place louis xv	1443.7494
the next day m dessessarts valet came to dartagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres	2451.9863
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself	468.1276
ten kicks on his back said dartagnan be off you little villain and forget not that i have your address  friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine and disappeared	658.5847
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat	1055.0685
i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again	737.7632
as a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of rochelleas at suze and perpignan  but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage we want men of talent	736.4132
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room	1224.7175
oh unhappy woman cried the commissary	1377.7009
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his  and these men are in france my lord  i believe so  tell me their names perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them  one of them was called the chevalier dartagnan  ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier dartagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal  that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed  but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel	336.9327
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error  well then if it be so are you ready albert  perfectly  let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy  yes let us do so  the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said  i signori francesi  the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	559.4301
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit	1105.9216
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme	574.9178
arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road	666.8848
it was ten oclock when they arrived	793.9202
a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	1056.9537
oh	91.6072
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her	1148.2910
respect to fallen majesty	881.2635
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms	800.2045
my horses said monte cristo	735.2143
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything  because she was in fear of being arrested  why has she not written to me then  because she was afraid of compromising you  dartagnan you restore me to life cried aramis	888.2318
andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty	1903.0828
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	260.4319
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ballthat which contained the letter  the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud	454.1418
monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment	671.5616
a night is soon passed and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows	499.6239
all this will not advance your outfit said athos for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you	463.9958
i had better get on horseback and go and meet her	597.9316
of course you stopped at your fathers a feeling of faintness came over villefort	796.2013
madame said dartagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall bemy life  and with this conclusiona way peculiar to himselfhe rose and left the room	354.6216
the footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand dants guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier	1111.8505
and you did cry he asked	403.5458
aramis  the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance and who answered to the last of these three names immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part and advanced toward the cabinet the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered	353.4413
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	410.3489
i will show you the way and he went in first	258.6494
the swiss became as purple as a peony	673.3925
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study opened	1638.8462
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal	646.9717
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one cannot incline ones self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi	757.0785
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress	1051.9443
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries  at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips	868.1257
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball	1090.5623
he had fainted	2174.3635
the watchword is king and r  saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the camp	932.1710
the latter retained the counts hand between his	1262.3025
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	656.7772
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	1607.5565
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six oclock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening	732.6819
where does he live  rue frou two steps from here  let us go  both resumed their way	1438.5198
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	372.8673
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment	1029.4025
suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his watchit was half past four	1574.0120
give me the pocket book la carconte and find a bag somewhere  la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag	1011.5866
yes before witnesses  oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it  there has been a crime said monte cristo	1594.1729
years have elapsed many events have happened alas	412.8065
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis	1099.8046
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away	465.0073
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other hand	1569.4297
the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the prince de conti the brother of the prince de cond and the duc de longueville his brother in law	1541.9949
as i told you it is an old family jewel  and yousold it asked dartagnan hesitatingly	915.5847
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side	1801.0570
what is your name  i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat	304.1389
well what is this island  the island of monte cristo  but i have no permission to shoot over this island  your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited  ah indeed said the young man	578.8219
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all  god abandons him who abandons himself said milady	1709.4694
porthos is in picardy  then aloud  and he has taken his ancient name of vallon  to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth  so that porthos will be a baron  i dont doubt it	591.6064
i did my best to make them drunk	750.5718
as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared	967.5788
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague	911.7256
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him	252.7674
the king however who sought distraction while traveling as fast as possiblefor he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty thirdstopped from time to time to fly the magpie a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes and for which he had always preserved a great predilection	1362.5192
monsieur and dear friend  ah yes	545.7562
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric	1871.8253
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face	1399.5046
chapter lix	229.0013
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection	545.6473
there is no hurry you know	582.8120
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary at this strange and unexpected demand m de villefort and his father exchanged looks	635.5991
madame bonacieux murmured dartagnan	1661.9021
come this way gentlemen come m villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities  he then took villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest	1189.7791
idiots	54.6255
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers	771.1349
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme	727.1511
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel	493.8149
ay that will doat armentires  where is that armentires  a little town on the lys i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country  capital	829.1798
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter	628.7923
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to obey	475.5863
in truth madame do you think that can be possible  indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad	683.6827
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly	1255.5845
repeat it cried dartagnan it will make a little change  not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse  the devil said dartagnan	368.6237
come let me show you my plan  the abb then showed dants the sketch he had made for their escape	644.3679
yes it is i my unclei the son of miladyi the monki the secretary and friend of cromwelli know you now both you and your companions  in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins	1205.1782
one may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens	2085.4963
no but franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before him	466.6755
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom	663.2281
what diabolical villainy you have performed here said porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone	969.4524
the next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mottoes	1300.1552
heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond  you are right dartagnan i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me	769.6112
whom shall i announce said the attendant	747.2614
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of dartagnan cruelly mystified him	602.0196
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m noirtiers room	941.1645
in a moment they were at the canebire	446.4670
your excellency he said the master of the htel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf  a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz	361.4342
what is the matter with you my friend asked the latter	237.9897
the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited	1348.5031
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost	708.0838
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the 8th of septemberthat is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my lifethe abb busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire	1025.2411
do you regret them asked morrel with his open laugh	724.3697
my lord said dartagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time	681.9658
mazarin especially  yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly estimated	611.4303
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again	463.8062
dartagnan slipped into the wardrobe	665.7775
so much the worse and so much the better  it need not be said that dartagnan was still thinking of the husband	324.4648
so would you said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men	568.6613
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright	429.2397
m	49.6746
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abb and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	429.8019
now the queen is of a sensitive nature	469.0870
sir said valentine i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i diemy grandfather and maximilian  i will watch over them as i have over you  well sir do as you will with me and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me  whatever may happen valentine do not be alarmed though you suffer though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin	355.7794
but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing rooms the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young ladys diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly	967.1166
confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host	536.7723
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep	646.6462

to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealththat first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man	1006.0590

it is really wonderful said the count above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight  it is indeed said danglars	558.4299
but dartagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	617.5472
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us  friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable  then you have some other motive unknown to us  athos smiled and dartagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head	844.5527
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape	606.3538

the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves	1304.6846
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint mrans and he arranged mentally while dants awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence	1786.8580
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	1402.2894
the young woman hastened to meet him	864.8669
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	1293.0027

he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller	701.9801
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming	1070.8855

what do you want with me said she	248.9121
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter  but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	612.0464
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen	708.6375
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it	460.7842

they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier	507.0442
dartagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion	747.4424

well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	293.6950
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying  great god exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand	551.2446

heaven pardon me cried edmond falling on his knees before his father	940.2243
it was m de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers	920.6337
i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	939.3353
but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore  yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular htels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them  these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness	398.3868
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it	453.8358
yes my friend  a presentation	1117.0472
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought	1108.3976
then you were going to rueil  yes	581.2079
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping	784.4968
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in two parties had set out for paris	750.8320
and now gentlemen thats well continued the cardinal	824.7020
morrel attributed penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer	914.6658
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill dartagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts	470.4032
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to lepee du grand henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us there  the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated	412.1733
years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined	1301.1723
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	525.4074
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise darmilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company	1627.8202
why didst thou take it  yeswhy asked la ramee	1470.6035
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated  i can sir said hayde drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mothers faiththis latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs a greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence	639.5568
then he rang	986.1005
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	713.9975
in what a tone you speak cried valentine	478.3093
i have what is still better	462.5014
no madame replied monte cristo but you see i make no resistance  we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove  the count looked at mercds as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking	494.2338
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence  we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of monsieur dartagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle  i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp  we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur dartagnan shall not leave us  the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men	1230.9088
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow	1037.5438
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria	1033.9178
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	574.3605
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order	780.5110
eh give it to me said the young man	163.4269
confide in me	110.0561
you dont know them	963.9265
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box	336.5500
it is his way and you must take him as you find him  at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act	284.6595
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur dartagnan theres not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him  then my lord replied dartagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much youunderstand me  be it so	671.5645

there was a postscript  i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent  in his convent	489.9540
holloa said he what does that mean  if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done  crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal	341.2490
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	745.5818
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me  oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad  i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me	532.7399
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him	768.3748
for me	170.2262
now let us try to take our revenge  i will assist you with all my heart monseigneur be assured of that  how did it come about  at half past twelve the queen was with her women  where  in her bedchamber  go on  when someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress  and then  the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale  and then and then  she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes i shall soon return she then opened the door of her alcove and went out  why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly  nothing was certain besides her majesty had said ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the queen  how long did the queen remain out of the chamber  three quarters of an hour  none of her women accompanied her  only donna estafania  did she afterward return  yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately  and when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her  no  does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket  yes the diamond studs which his majesty gave the queen  and she came back without this casket  yes  madame de lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham  she is sure of it  how can she be so  in the course of the day madame de lannoy in her quality of tire woman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the queen  and then the queen  the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired  he must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or not  i have just been with him  and the goldsmith  the goldsmith has heard nothing of it  well well	631.5992
i really never heard a person speak as you do  because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings  and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us  why should they not	827.5994
and king charles is well as i have just heard  he is dead my lord said aramis	412.0281

the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings	1183.3461
the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the wagon wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time planchets halberdiers appeared at the corner of the cemetery of the innocents and louvieress bourgeois at the corner of the rue de la monnaie	1635.5618

the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders	1216.0829

the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression	833.0847
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	682.5530
sit down in mercy  dartagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge	903.6829
the life of the four young men had become fraternal	818.0037
at length franz arrived at the word myself	936.8910
dartagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it	593.7402

villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms	386.5711
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea  undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it  but said dartagnan it is the queens diamond  the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos	800.3377
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion	630.9508
yes and important	558.0239
give the lackeys money and they will start  we will give them money replied athos	606.9962
he took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his finger	369.8801
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all dartagnan wished	1032.7048
certainly as m danglars says you are rich and perfectly free	869.2399
poor dear monsieur dartagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans hand	855.1036
davrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man	1146.6720
no no but wounded without doubt killed perhaps	1238.6195

good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man	1004.4551
i believe with your majesty that monsieur de trvilles guarantee is more than sufficient  trville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding	1021.3014
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread	1410.6129
dont you remember porthos we saw her at general cromwells  the roll call continued	1134.5094
oh oh he at length muttered do you see  what	572.4424
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurators wife with a sigh	685.7825
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained	454.5091

adieu brother cried milady	1601.2777
whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery	1837.7571
a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond	926.2573

a fine and white stocking a silken robe a lace kerchief a pretty slipper on the foot a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty but they make a pretty woman beautiful without reckoning the hands which gain by all this the hands among women particularly to be beautiful must be idle	1439.9986

all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	398.2761
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m morrel to aid dants he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	970.1276
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling  the queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away	1534.0515

during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life	1373.6812
so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock  now then let us calculate how much we posses in all  porthos  thirty crowns  aramis  ten pistoles  and you dartagnan  twenty five  that makes in all said athos	924.3428

perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable  dartagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis	407.0290

i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands  you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much  you have rightly guessed madame replied the count	952.4439
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his lifethat of standing behind a gilded carriage	614.2752

nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece  peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french  speak italian sir	786.4459
he is i think the son of general dpinay  he is  the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815  by the bonapartists  yes	535.0206

can it be with me	143.4664
here sir said a voice behind him	368.4374

for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the rue st denis or the faubourg st germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a caf on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julienand yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes	2244.3235

it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours grace	868.4271

the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis  and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger	1475.8374
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention  monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures  the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself  we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her  sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers	695.9578

in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur dherblay our crime would be confirmed	1136.7778

gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so  this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	280.5337
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast	878.4308

well asked he of the count what has then happened  nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced	286.1332
a hundred pistoles said dartagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as job	721.1586
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep	673.3494
stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time  hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms	1262.2760

for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive  and once more he bowed low before his highness	503.6898
destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth  and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	565.0677
what would you have said the musketeer	211.4504

albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him	426.8136
for a moment dartagnan thought that parrys brother had disappeared but he was mistaken	742.8192
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain  sure to gain repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count	839.7384

it is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness  comminges bowed and left	517.0097
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of gods anger  ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilians face	524.8691
now said trville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence	529.5234
between six and seven oclock the road of chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy  but suppose we all go said dartagnan what the devil	777.8126
god was still in his heart	238.1918

his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately	1394.8004
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder	1661.9552
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another	543.1613

come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you  god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really cannot pretend to lament it	686.2892
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation	1194.7712

mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	1183.0448

the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from m duchtel or from m montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek words tle graphein	581.8776

it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	528.7072
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from	484.2348

the jailer continued  now this was his project	671.9255
he did not look like an executioner  and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office  but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	878.6638
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king	391.5426
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better  this exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder	411.2012
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend	517.7644

anne of austria deprived of the confidence of her husband pursued by the hatred of the cardinal who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling having before her eyes the example of the queen mother whom that hatred had tormented all her lifethough marie de mdicis if the memoirs of the time are to be believed had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which anne of austria always refused himanne of austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her her most intimate confidants her dearest favorites	389.8681
you know anne of austria the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go i am a dead man  i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear dartagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer	729.2397
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle  oh heavens cried athos	2291.1372

three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	1270.4303
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door  dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	659.0538
as he had twenty times touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	1246.8457
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions	785.3010
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	1646.1072
the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her	703.6003

i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related	721.2040
he hoped to meet with m de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs	607.3883
here i await thee  there was profound silence	1636.4277
yes said he	94.4079
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours  monte cristo shrugged his shoulders	339.7786
peste returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me 3000 francs  let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself	1058.6848
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english	626.3740
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris  yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugnie	1044.9971
courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the queen  to her and to you cried dartagnan	279.2368
the door of their cabin was opened	654.4291
yes  but the contract the same smile returned	464.0371
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too latethere is not a single carriage to be hadthat is for the three last days  yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed  what is the matter said albert entering no carriage to be had  just so returned franz you have guessed it  well your eternal city is a nice sort of place  that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please  ah that is something said albert today is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday  ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult  my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future  at least we can have a window  where  in the corso  ah a window exclaimed signor pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day  the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction	741.1068
but m de trville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queens eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful	303.2599
mousqueton	76.2244
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte	1751.3046
what is to be done asked dartagnan	241.5500
listen said morrel it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position which is a serious and urgent one i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret	389.7264
once upon a time well go on  signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them	654.0582
well here i am be satisfied	611.5680
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i cannot explain to you	379.8404
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half hours interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes	1093.8756
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed dartagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her	1065.9554
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him	943.7413
do not believe what albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever	1063.1027
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity  he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde whilst mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the palais royal	747.5183
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	634.5413
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating	585.9127
morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what dants had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him	701.4122
dartagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy	2258.3391
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball	352.2191
there were four musketeers on the bottom steps amusing themselves with the following exercise while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport	1095.4855
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	1269.3761
i will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities  at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale	703.6873
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistressyour mistress above all  dartagnan blushed	649.8868
put him to death  franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	481.6056
yes my poor girl replied morrel i come to bring and to hear bad tidings  this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full  dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious	588.8486
yes admirable	1486.4793
as he approached it noirtiers gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart	868.7563
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the htel and flew toward kittys chamber	344.9554
who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning	989.6744
do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille  oh a day and night soon pass away	328.8936
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal	500.3674
god forbid  then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other	608.5560
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti  i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abb busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris  is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo	680.6319
m bonacieux was at his door	315.7936
when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost	1402.5543
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping  the abb smiled	744.4116
never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself  willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way  say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind	855.2104
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	1297.0239
absolution father	1112.5516
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils	1781.2306
the glance was of sublime eloquence	1515.3207
you know theres only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party  yes i know that he said but give me the particulars  you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two	416.7975
do you understand  thats no doubt very fine said porthos but deuce take me if i understand at all  porthos my friend you know i am descended on the fathers side from the prophets and on the mothers from the sybils and that i only speak in parables and riddles	720.4703
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercds seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly	531.3894
then we are once more reunited said andrea	1253.8560
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it	1152.5061
give me those papers and leave us  the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired	505.8387
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens  you shall have no weapon left in your power  there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it	708.9629
but come i am waiting for you  both men entered monte cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no	520.7795
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general  i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii	373.1396
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meconstance disappeared	1259.0396
i will go myself and fetch the lemonade  davrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame de villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen	1124.9985
dartagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for	784.7418
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt	686.8251
20169m    behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions	1576.3320
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper	1678.8683
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach	604.6414
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate	590.9424
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dants would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsdaume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project	969.0259
chapter 99 the law  we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	1759.0647
to the rescue as usual this htel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their comrades	540.8989
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people	601.7211
well be it so said she	187.2921
this singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy	892.7238
if ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly	2475.5374
about forty leagues only	1102.9075
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture	674.5821
why dont we go in with them asked porthos	427.7716
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than theythat of a conference	1090.7235
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance	1773.8988
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard	1115.5648
for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks	1218.5778
so that i have no society i live alone i am sick of itmy mind preys on itself  dartagnan smiled	1123.5842
it seemed to all three that they knew him	345.3919
why then doesnt he attend to it himself as at chantilly  ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges	472.8773
oh my god i have suffered enough surely	1089.1887
now is that all  i believe so  let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth dartagnan and athos to the bastille aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse porthos an ass madame bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion armentires on the banks of the lys	1631.8545
oh	38.1395
dartagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarins ante room	550.4824
pray speak of it for i shall not only i trust relate the little i do know but also a great deal i do not know  it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened  20249m    well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do not know  that is but fair replied monte cristo	347.1160
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux	934.8213
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world  i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news  ah indeed said monte cristo	831.8486
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident  as to the rest m de trville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously	572.8613
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	809.8256
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	2195.5715
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you  pray dont mention such a thing said the count	675.4116
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly	563.4114
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you  you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude  as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	206.3213
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun	186.2230
are you going to leave me  i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me  the count stopped	438.3164
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations	1035.8710
i am saved  yes said felton but silence silence	1020.1703
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services  the two young men bowed	710.1884
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth	895.5565
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over  here my lords	355.8169
is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably	1107.2867
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them	807.8201
by kittys chamber he could gain that of her mistress	911.3570
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme	392.6003
pardieu said i my good gentleman i have a horse to sell too ay and a very fine one	450.8138
hush whispered de guiche these are cavaliers  yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted  can you see what they are doing  yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man  it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche	934.0897
i think so am i not right m de villefort asked monte cristo	522.4243
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de trville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my htel	455.2813
then he mentally addedstill my unknown protector	1163.6506
and this room he asked pointing to the captains cabin	906.7380
planchet	58.0130
at chlons i was put upon the sane thence i passed on to the rhne whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles	1279.3868

beauchamp was in his bath	399.8717
oh no exclaimed edmond that will not be	416.4020
as little sensitive as was the heart of dartagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance	574.4333
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the cross	804.5555

i was for twenty years cardinal spadas secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government  why from the french government  because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department  ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy  my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abb faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and csar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom  monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly  it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent  very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of  the food is the same as in other prisonsthat is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance  we are coming to the point whispered the governor	603.7566
the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully  i only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight  do not be alarmed said beauchamp he will meet you	375.0562
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts	776.2097
by the way planchet i think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low wretch  ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you anything	328.1974
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe	516.2374

let us shut this one up they put the stone back in its place the abb sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in	851.9343
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit	268.6948
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces	441.1566
we will do the same  the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with dartagnan	353.9675
your affectionate anne   buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte  the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted  and is that allis that all replied buckingham impatiently	710.5695

caderousse became thoughtful	345.9215
what dost thou there rascal asked comminges	126.4132
my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton	1188.5872
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself	1193.2243
what is he doing	310.2003
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray	688.8058
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	1024.6042
i must die  then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame	720.2319
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf  the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair	796.1572
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse  well  it is a forgery  how can that be  yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you  but it is dartagnan that will come  do not deceive yourself	352.1454
by the bye continued dartagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body  the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and dartagnan went out followed by bernouin	704.8348

but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it  and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation	745.4979
if they had discovered miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to bthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends	663.5375

sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties  it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers  you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort	547.2715

i speak as i can i restrain myself	680.1926
lend me your backbut dont let the cardinal go  porthos lent him his back and dartagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself	562.0134
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod	1317.1356
or the mysterious benefactress said athos	1365.0756
was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning  then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner  the london executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead	518.7653
0057m    danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him  certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dants arrested	886.6987
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten  no said maximilian you shall not leave him	1002.8231
so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and la ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster	704.9373
athos was pale and trembled in every limb	1423.2942
richelieu   and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can  and he left the chamber without once looking behind him	923.0232
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	1271.4957
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london  why so  because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road  is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering  one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice  ah	859.4501
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against dartagnanprojects lost in the distance of the future	924.7316
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment  yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off  as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen	586.8186
0175m    but said the abb i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions  the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn	362.2163
she perceived felton who sat with his back toward her	820.9589
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve  but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugnie i saw you arranging a depositis not that the termof five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning  yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken	748.6452
no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her	536.0009
well be on our side now resumed aramis	804.0731
why do you not realize a six months a years advance even and retire to brussels	910.9039
whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard	584.9089
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it	654.7553
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue	331.7464
how do you mean said valentine looking anxiously around	1242.4509
a great pity said monte cristo	1026.7811
the two friends were in the via dei pontefici	2303.4290
ah	19.2867
pshaw	36.2218
in the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone	946.8835
he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away	520.2399
ah here is one of them i believe  in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared	389.8261
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m de trville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions	620.6578
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair	425.8148
the next two days passed in much the same way	589.0999
as for dartagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him	613.0696
chapter xxx	734.2810
as they went from the htel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrire de la villette and the other by the barrire montmartre to meet again beyond st denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results	1355.8689
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour	672.6552
speak gentlemen speaki am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	1551.4014
take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred pistoles  dartagnan only required one reason to be satisfied	653.6613
a few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate	681.5504
she is amiable and well behaved  what is her name  she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty	677.5554
chapter xvii	398.7973
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo	750.0026
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the htel de londres	474.3764
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy  but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	424.8701
loose half drunk imposing the kings musketeers or rather m de trvilles spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m de trville being there to claim them	1263.8666
all four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	667.1721
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward	516.3800
that man is cromwell said he	304.1934
and has this man displayed a friendship for you albert she asked with a nervous shudder	746.6196
now said dartagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it  i hope the accident has been of no consequence  they dont yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured  at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper	552.8008
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him	582.0507
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages	716.4592
monsieur dartagnan it cried	288.6041
good luck to you  the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at la canebire	623.9852
interrogate me i entreat you  where is your wife in the first place  why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me  yes but yesterday at five oclock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped  my wife escaped cried bonacieux	346.4078
i hope so was the reply	353.3784
he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair	1128.0609
is it from mere humanity you bid me live	1736.3250
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinals party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinala confidence which he had so well earnedhe received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queens apartments	1041.0938
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all i want  oh muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him	398.0320
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau asked the count are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodesin which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures  yes sir indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon  monte cristo shuddered antoine had been his jailer	1064.2950
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered	1079.1322
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity  and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it  yes your excellency	1445.1276
i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the vein  she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	584.4751
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy	459.8456
i have only two adversariesi will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even themthey are time and distance	1720.8265
dartagnan smiled	1592.6052
we are mistaken said dartagnan	539.0299
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you  i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	493.1060
it matters little now to me	516.0331
adieu dear sister till your next swoon  this was all that milady could endure	1233.6082
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise	847.8271
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villeforts departure	1561.1285
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos	231.6297
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach	1873.6453
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark	1190.7269
50089m    maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtiers eyes seemed to sayquicker quicker  in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentines	1355.6963
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing	932.6360
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience	840.4635
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	1872.5083
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	1423.1251
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was extinguishedthen all was dark and stillthe floating bark and heaving ocean	918.9560
well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself  stay said the young man	629.9732
weak or strong repeated milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark i will make a flame that shall devour him	609.9717
what happened then she asked	804.0807
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to breakfast	366.3782
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers	269.7556
here you are home again raoul said the comte	575.4307
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	954.5285
well yes pretty well replied dartagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere  yes that is inevitable said porthos	726.8414
my name isah	562.9590
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon  felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony	679.9150
come speak my worthy corsican speak  what do you wish me to say  i will help you	552.4255
i understand answered porthos i understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it but what will people say  let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it  but who will distribute these things asked porthos	693.1275
chapter 7 the examination  no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands	1058.0646
in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine sand	1007.8234
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor  and ii tell you against both	352.8179
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes  good he accepts said monte cristo	468.2010
30099m    the third act passed off as usual	945.0175
who was it you were talking with over there she asked	366.6692
i warn you however his services will cost you something	1170.3496
with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint mran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at m de villeforts in connection with his attachment for valentine	600.1460
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said  but where is madame de longueville  ah yes where is my sister asked the prince	390.3126
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows  gentlemen	2049.3657
it was mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	1210.0734
nightwhy for heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark  indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions	620.1555
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch	1413.5149
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count	1315.6166
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	945.6909
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death  it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton	492.7222
do you think of him  yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next after monsieur de cond comes the duke of orleans  what are you saying	750.0140
come fernand wont you return to marseilles with us  no said fernand i shall return to the catalans  youre wrong	903.2357
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angelthose suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge  50165m    the young woman hid her face in her hands	1352.8330
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said	569.9454
dants cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven	2020.7445
this evening the margin of possible delay expires  what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them to night  pardieu	986.6094
those barrels i saw through the door  port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum	1268.2314
wait said aramis that is an idea  of which i invite you to take advantage my friend	377.6492
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dants handled the helm	1389.5568
ay said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan  i have none said athos but dartagnan will discover one  dartagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded	330.7226
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude	300.2224
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers  thats true said dants but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation  this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	1006.3209
although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty	2213.5811
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened  what is the matter sire exclaimed lord leven	383.3964
yes  and who is the man  i do not know  why did he not bring it to me here  the messenger did not say  and where is the messenger  he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you  oh said the countess to franz go with all speedpoor young man	183.2983
they have some business with you i think from what they told me the day before yesterday	408.5683
chapter lv	1431.2985
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	1053.5829
remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors	1030.7576
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companionit is true then that all our actions leave their tracessome sad others brighton our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sandsit leaves its track	1064.0105
but i am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time  here goes the barony said the queen she signed a patent	610.9877
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	675.1221
accused said the president your name and surname  andrea arose	1301.1067
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work	1781.2407
the young girl hastily took the letter from him	638.5262
the house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here  yes my friend returned the count and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master  oh monsieur said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all  what was the name of your old master said monte cristo	696.3353
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen	1151.2104
dants thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	408.5504
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud  yes as an augustine monk  what sized man is he  about my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair  and he did not see raoul asked athos	794.1060
felton grew pale	1115.4394
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially	384.4513
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil  he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him	1049.2656
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	637.8789
i recognize you perfectly  the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion	1281.4034
then the landing began	914.9392
it was almost broad daylight	938.2990
i have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible  yes said porthos	960.3004
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart	1849.3407
in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the suns genial influence when the cloud has passed	2378.1221
madame danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth	713.1060
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroadin france as in europe  your majesty probably refers to god said m de trville for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty  no monsieur i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friendof the cardinal  his eminence is not his holiness sire  what do you mean by that monsieur  that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals  you mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me	1422.4712
my profession condemns me to celibacy	1060.4811
oh dear no your excellency	823.7800
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons	1070.9840
you do not understand asked felton	772.3482
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh	1063.8101
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter	981.0517
chapter lxxxix	1093.1695
what do you mean beauchamp  oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the ministers said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain	688.3061
the worthy mercer had immediately upon re entering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit	164.8378
there was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his shoulders	271.8932
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire  hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible  at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	431.2737
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugnie to the opera	1433.2688
well what is it asked louis xviii	848.6656
bazin remained at the window	364.3256
ah	52.7835
the old mans declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said  then doubtless dear m noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort  the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred	1242.2389
you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself  20125m    teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felices daughter	1059.2766
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you	400.9789
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well	1075.0015
parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle	432.6280
my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your eminence orders an escalade  but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal	563.8463
the young girl looked at morrel	827.4262
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me	1069.4720
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	721.2588
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf  pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert albert understood his thoughts	1176.2778
he will never see you again all is over	418.2572
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me  40168m    no for i saw gods justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence  gods justice	637.0248
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me  to you	810.5067
on the staircase he met signor pastrini	1709.2793
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome  with pleasure  there was a cry of shut up from the audience	348.8515
chapter xlii	481.0594
i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know  there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at auteuil to that you went to you know  yes  i was saying to him only yesterday you are imprudent monsieur count for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected well said he what next well next some day you will be robbed  what did he answer  he quietly said what do i care if i am  andrea he has some secretaire with a spring  how do you know  yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune	460.2275
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time	406.6860
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure  oh my legs my poor legs	495.1311
when i was at rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became master and everything went ill when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution	1308.4906
impossible  morrel started	295.6058
what cried dartagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos  yes that disturbs you  by no means  and here is the second  dartagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis	484.9070
at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot	591.9343
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	1146.1101
ah my mother my poor mother said albert gazing through his tears at his mothers portrait if you know this how much must you suffer  come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend  but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal	926.0042
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth	908.1733
behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door closed	803.6835
if she objects to your marrying m dpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition  no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marriage itself  marriage	602.1631
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad  mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	1256.2887
the return   dartagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation	739.7320

doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again  dants did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	470.8938
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him	731.1215
you dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said porthos	643.1174
what are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust i did not send for you i think  baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter	412.2201
have you any money  dartagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket	488.7109
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactorthen count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols	1388.0078
for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal     chapter x a mousetrap in the seventeenth century   the invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days as soon as societies in forming had invented any kind of police that police invented mousetraps	1361.2587
on arriving at the extremity of the castle dartagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv and surmounted by four stately gilded weather cocks	889.5704
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal linesgod knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc dangoulme themselves watched over by the cardinalan inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days	798.8381
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men	432.5129
pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands  listen madame said gondy	633.6197
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected	346.2802
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish ityou are inflexible	1521.3545
yes for time presses  how many men have you about the palais royal  six hundred  place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me  madame cried mazarin what are you about  go said the queen	865.3454
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him  the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire	459.7704
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive	494.6778
does the cardinal refuse to receive the king	400.1868
yes monsieur a most excellent sister  married  nearly nine years  happy asked the count again	1505.4624
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost	1347.6423
26  on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge	599.4421
her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight	616.8762
are there then two parliaments  my friend dartagnan interrupted as i dont understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance  ah	917.8582
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly  i shall go he said to the queen  well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris  to whom  zounds	443.4669
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with dartagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of dartagnan	418.0698
there was no answer and she continued  i have not seen you all day	304.6283
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the bankers house	539.0317
by force	1285.0638
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison	865.3479
his eminence then orders me said the lady	519.3491
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room	1004.5748
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated  deaddead  50090m      chapter 103 maximilian  villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief	1119.7649
on seeing him the regiment of corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces put them into confusion and re entered charenton flying	710.7965
but i am not yet ready to receive it  very well	458.5411
while i watched the window he guarded the door  good said athos	349.9139
he is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars	615.9471
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud  well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act  my lord said dartagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier dherblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your eminence  and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis	530.8327
he had given his word not to watch mme	504.7315
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing	1063.4038
sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour  half an hours rest is enough replied the gascon	1117.8171
but what if i were mistaken  a shudder passed over him	601.0332
on the doorsteps davrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others	1430.8741
if so speak out answered athos	777.1086
chapter xxxiv	1403.0313
mazarin came within three steps of dartagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place	669.1266
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldnt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain	1181.1243
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that	750.2512
the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio	933.4410
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty  anne hesitated	840.0311
what is it asked the baroness	261.0370
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word	427.3761
but stop	1502.3327
this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse	2068.0991
at the barrire du trne they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post	1398.3672
then he pointed to the door	181.5895
who wrote for particulars concerning my father  i imagine anyone may write to yanina  but one person only wrote  one only  yes and that was you  i doubtless wrote	1512.1996
ten minutes afterward she was at home	1070.0601
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept	446.5015
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i believed	382.4125
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	769.0906
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleonwell can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey	1036.5104
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de larbre sec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	1026.0896
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercds tremble	404.2478
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls	1180.8367
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured dartagnan	748.5288
do you think he would recollect you  my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me  well go and talk with the boy said dartagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead  planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible while dartagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts	391.1548
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	823.1003
i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercds to know if i should find her still free	476.5470
do you know saint mandrier  i do  in the hour of rest between noon and one oclock  galley slaves having a nap after dinner	1166.5392
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim	434.3069
god only knows	1438.0698
13 murmured he growing still paler	508.7822
how long a start have they  two hours and a quarter my officer  two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not porthos  porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses	657.8788
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	800.1133
it could no longer be doubted the family name was fully given	1156.0601
no my friend i was wrong to caution you do not fear i will bury my grief so deep in my heart i will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me	620.8195
now if you please remove your bandage the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes	937.1931
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count	1362.5198
the count advanced to meet him	569.1749
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus	1109.3103
on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and lost	1344.3146
but m de trville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him everything	486.1247
while he was endeavoring to calm his fearsand instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long sleptthe noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masters grief	1174.6726
you know that i dont like it	307.1023
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword	597.0826
the hands were white but without delicacy the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality	1125.3885
no before a woman you would dare not fly i presume  remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything  you are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses	828.0759
a dinner in the old style	727.3519
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources	968.1819
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	625.6871
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title	469.2767
this is recent news sir continued she and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow perhaps after to morrowthe last of all paris  madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian  your guardian	621.0178
escape had never once occurred to him	542.4153
no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence rene uttered a smothered exclamation	651.1309
neither you nor myself but fernand you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed i fancied i had destroyed it  oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not	365.9078
dartagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice	321.3225
many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room	817.4986
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them  you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide	600.5691
i have returned guitant	1815.9222
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth	2000.8434
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	517.4075
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary and yet this letter must be somewhere  would you dare to lift your hand to your queen said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening	527.7891
a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less  but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine  ifaith i dont know	1813.7198
along the isle of dogs  and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another	689.9902
besides he is an englishman	401.7979
indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish  i foppish	1775.2332
you ride on our lackeys horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages  at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads	1458.3159
speak  tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught theres every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to behung  true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest  now resumed grimaud ive only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest me  ill try said the duke	610.1416
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him  you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me  let us see the watch said albert	1566.4817
put it up again my friend said dartagnan	330.7280
besides one must lay out ones inheritance somehow  ah porthos cried one of his companions dont try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity	1229.5656
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike  the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame	972.6343
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majestys service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count  well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me	1100.7059
i am no swordsman  well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all  this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter	678.1921
him i can place at your disposal it is count de rochefort  i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris  my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette  and wherefore has he not been to see me  he was toldmy lord will pardon me  certainly speak  that your lordship was about to treat with the court  gondy bit his lips	490.0861
yes if you really wish it said dartagnan and even with great pleasure i confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite  ah my poor friend said aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected  am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur  oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers	481.2596
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk	552.2053
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child	802.8658
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell	975.3680
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground	1630.4918
when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeursthat is to say when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii	795.4427
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied dartagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed	522.7263
bonacieux	13.9996
why ill wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too  done said danglars ill take your bet but tomorrowtoday it is time to return	1127.1490
will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me  thanks count no replied de winter	610.8609
in this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25000000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30000 pounds of gunpowder	359.9907
to one in edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value	882.6561
seven oclock in the morning	277.3544
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	883.9251
dartagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before	447.3290
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours  i have sometimes thought as you do athos  she had a son that unhappy woman  yes  have you ever heard of him  never  he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone	833.2345
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter	573.0605
the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around dartagnan and his companions	81.8173
ah yes he said i know them	235.8856
you see he said to porthos	160.5977
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters  devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion  egad said dartagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing  my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebut i shoot sometimes that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits  really how very amusing  yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing  dartagnan now no longer counted the sighs	768.0443
dartagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us go  at this moment laporte reappeared	1274.1965
it cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts	1643.6412
everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire	2474.1143
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned it all  but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love  forgive me replied morrel i will go away  no said valentine you might meet someone stay  but if anyone should come here  the young girl shook her head	525.0427
i read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house  it is not yet too late cried bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission i will find you a better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at bellevue  oh no returned monte cristo negligently since i have this i will keep it  and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee	682.1203
is our little neighbor worse asked dartagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth	763.5529
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at estre sometimes at jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment	1253.5343
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	410.5613
i was going about at random inquiring of everybody when i saw you gallop past	1149.8159
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed  oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune	636.6109
nobody serves me for nothing	1196.7834
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest	573.0908
you shall soon see him	608.3407
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our placecry down with mazarin  i will down with mazarin  in french in good french my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly	369.4657
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me  oh cried andrea leaping with joy	279.5594
now in the army from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones death	464.8510
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it	844.8637
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him	575.3651
take my arm and let us go  dartagnan offered his arm to mme	517.5464
excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case  and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer	501.0810
pardon me my god receive me oh my lord  caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan	863.4119
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine	1282.7336
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france	321.2332
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abb adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly  it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	2458.5623

no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released  mercds and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door	578.0116
four hundred and seventy five livres said dartagnan who reckoned like archimedes	590.4064
about what time  why about fifteen or eighteen days ago  exactly so  and yesterday evening he came again  yesterday evening  yes just before you came  my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies	1451.1003
but where you go i go  they then set off for rueil	663.2777
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices	456.9815
it does replied the abb with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dants which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors  and why among us four inquired caderousse	721.1219
dartagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were fired	710.5440
well eugnie what is it you want with me	340.6020
if there are two let parry kill one and you the other	398.9556
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave with these words the baron went out	365.2506
the ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus ball	1642.3352
he pressed the counts hand and left	583.3091
he remained there some time alone	950.1899
3 1627   it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	259.7027

pardieu said dartagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friends house	788.2570

she knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by buckinghamand buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in questiononce this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors	1092.4745
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary	1359.7180
the three valets passed without accident	265.3097
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table  yes monsieur  that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it  deposited with the justice they said it was bad money  very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles  but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of	304.9725

they opened it and found 900000 francs in bank scrip	1891.3522
you were deceived sir i was not praying  do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	583.0666
meantime dartagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	618.1361
his three companions joined him	2341.6870

heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing  danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured	728.4806
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself	591.1795
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness  at these words there appeared in noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you  do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine	869.4708
porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual	700.3531

andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy five thousand livres per annum	1400.1147
im your man  i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal  here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner	488.4034
no	69.8905
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me  this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured	242.5225
i wish to tell him to make my child happy i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey mein fact i will know himi will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty  madame said villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness	504.0533
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition  what  that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me  dont dream it athos	767.5900
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais  dartagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation	410.1179
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects  and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit	834.2276
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild  five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	715.6339
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words  fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentines room  morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barroiss situation and in noirtiers name gave that order	244.3883
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke	413.9911

so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of csars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreadshe who dreads nothing as it is said	624.4892
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme	349.9858
cruel enough if i am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent  i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received  do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges	437.2414
but listen they appear to be speaking of me  dartagnan drew near the window and lent his ear	611.4869
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said morrel with a smile full of grief i am under his orders for the next month  oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said julie	501.3398
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury  do then as i did my lord	390.0140
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired  what then is this precious stuff  did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste  of course i have  well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name	1079.7467
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before  instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen	513.3108
let us rather kill them	1336.2371
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse	643.8740
we keep him in the cellar	406.5352
two aces  the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment	1080.3513
never  sire i entreat you to do so  besides in what manner can i make advances first  by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her  what is that  give a ball you know how much the queen loves dancing	670.8163
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god	362.0143
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you	693.8838
well a day	234.4113
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist	1199.8937
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him  now then go said the marquis	391.8334
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yardeugnie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle darmilly scarcely raised with both hands	1795.1813
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	618.6070
chapter 70 the ball  it was in the warmest days of july when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at m de morcerfs	961.3592
where are you going cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lovers calmness could not be real where are you going  i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as i am may follow  before you leave me tell me what you are going to do maximilian the young man smiled sorrowfully	677.3034
well then off to the nearest goldsmiths and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him	837.3066
athos is near you said dartagnan warn him as i have warned you  aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution	675.2054
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of lechelle ten oclock struck	894.7041
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercds  thats all right edmond	335.0670
in my country the ladies do without chambermaids	1481.2069
how ghastly pale he is  oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz	633.1479
thus dartagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means	1020.0939
he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited	511.6735
the scotchman	624.6691
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers	1416.2001
really said she i believe you now begin to hesitate  no i do not hesitate but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him	521.7404
let us try not to jest if we can	814.2408
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal	1356.3960
in the most simple and natural manner possible	933.3354
ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca	776.7303
proceed sire i beg	1726.9382
this immediately recalled to dartagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme	532.7861
as to his title and fortune  as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte  upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman	284.7334
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	515.6725
but then you understand madame coquenard a mule with feathers and bells  be satisfied said the procurators wife	1220.3234
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the alles de meilhan belonged dants next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given	753.0981
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dants approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	1119.9320
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight  then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch  take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	785.0820
but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king  the queen remained silent	405.9914
oblige me by taking a seat said dartagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm	1072.7396
well for my part i a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the kings executioni remain  athos turned pale	801.5939
die cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he	1412.3519
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table	1262.7347
15 a turkish pasha in command of the troops of a provinceed	1119.1281
yes  what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer	317.1906
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment  dartagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	1018.3462
he went to him	184.5466
at this instant the door opened	422.7253
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon  it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it	492.1985
you do not know what he is about in the cellar	260.2186
the kings	1356.3582
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear	797.6419
after this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave	754.6389
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth  do you propose to me to do so dartagnan  decidedly and honestly  on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon	425.1261
did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us  no  but have you ever watched him carefully  doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck meof all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing	551.2033
it appeared likewise that mme	1506.5361
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity	473.9154
ah	78.6752
you see m morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a weeks calm when captain gaumard comes up to mei was at the helm i should tell youand says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself	642.4697
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather  monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step	541.7639
so he cherishes no resentment  you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	1121.5059
what did you say sir asked the man	287.3627
he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreamsa coffer long and deep locked bolted fastened in the wall a coffer of which he had so often heard and which the handsa little wrinkled it is true but still not without eleganceof the procurators wife were about to open to his admiring looks	548.5562
the demands in that programme must be granted  we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations  you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling	1313.5737
let me look at that sapphire again the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident  dartagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos	594.3823
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild	1115.8009
most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished  indeed i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in  i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man  i beseech you madame replied monte cristo not to spoil ali either by too great praise or rewards	1217.5741
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	779.6008
it was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently beloved	630.6753
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away	961.4229
yes  and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father  noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may  maximilian understood him	589.5580
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	1379.8422
otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance  mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at dartagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance	910.4354
on entering the hotel dartagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire	491.3789
the next morning therefore when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of long live broussel long live our father resounded from all parts and was death to mazarins ears and the cardinals spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen	1141.4626
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visiting room	580.8377
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs	1438.7654
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress	659.5930
dartagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out	541.7112
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristos door	500.1033
a bargain was therefore struck	2066.3601
monsieur abb you are a great moralist  doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys  speak lower aramis said athos	618.8371
he was a stout man of about two  or three and twenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach	758.2700
ah i can understand that	332.1310
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb	824.9730
it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear	1890.7362
he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy	1892.9608
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	1314.0762
come hither i say and dont be afraid continued athos	893.9685
daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak	644.1946
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knowsdartagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	534.8372
i wish after such a scene to be alone  mazarin bent low before her	792.6404
all  answer then	1174.5392
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states	2000.0106
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of dartagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before	395.2146
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music	1102.7925
voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed	1697.9319
what do you mean asked valentine	675.0716
am i or am i not the queen	163.7167
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek  it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light  no valentine i assure you such is not the case	515.3999
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected	578.3887
yes sir he said	204.7990
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which i had to reply i called for help  yes yes that is true	383.4153
the palais de justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules	1413.4616
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular	992.5809
m de trville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip	934.6840
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them	464.7156
nevertheless she remained motionless	2092.8215
there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	810.4104
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio	1169.8921
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled	937.6137
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us  and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion  mousqueton smiled disdainfully	734.0726
teresa had a great desire to see this ball	447.5185
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop	2322.6421
they both stood in amazement at the door	699.2760
and you believe he died  of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse	589.3270
the abb busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone	1998.4796
he was a dead man and on my honor if i had discovered that it was his son i should have regretted having killed him  ah	254.4408
is that all then  in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory	497.1986
as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio	1005.8421
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him	1414.9230
take this pen and write  caderousse awed by the superior power of the abb sat down and wrote  sirthe man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon	1356.1656
have you been to the general said mordaunt to dartagnan and porthos you know he sent for you after the action  we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied dartagnan	186.4586
do you hear that madame	324.1385
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell	324.4549
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions	833.1701
it was evident that there was clamor and sedition	1056.7078
and aramis  i have seen him also said dartagnan but he seemed to me cold  ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on dartagnan a searching look	353.7390
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked dartagnan	283.7943
tienne soon returned from his errand	1802.2288
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands	747.7169
monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie  i should think so indeedalmost as high as a tower  you told him it was for me  yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness  good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands	1021.8494
have i sir comprehended your instructions  athos smiled	1687.1503
dartagnan ran after her	1127.0674
give way  at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late	451.5276
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon  ali obeyed leaving the abb alone with caderousse who had not yet revived	1015.2849
this brother was my only friend we became orphansi at five he at eighteen	1060.6737
i only wish he would let me take his place  shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of mercds two oclock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour  0071m    to be sureto be sure cried dants eagerly quitting the table let us go directly  his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers	867.6133
1d	28.3674
woe is me	133.0883
desideras diabolum unhappy man cried the jesuit	65.0613
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	762.9618
i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs  yes almost said aramis	782.7532
i will extinguish the fire with blood	1115.5775
sir said davrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentines maid if you please  villefort went himself to find her and davrigny approached noirtier	821.4010
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell down	1298.6194
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to dartagnans chair	1160.9213
alberts lips scarcely whispered good bye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	2118.6887
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money  the host became as pale as death for dartagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master	569.2387
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me  50155m    well be it so	494.2739
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp	461.3310
well whats the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now  no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man i ask you if you recognize him  that manwait a bit  ah	450.6242
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee  that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him  take care	1233.7382
go on my child said the count in the romaic language	431.4308
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still	1054.4921
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him	671.9346
let us go you mean  no my friend said athos you must leave us  leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	598.6749
come will you do to day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen  i will do everything your majesty commands replied dartagnan	275.2522
you are madames brother i learnbe it so but fortunately you are not mine  it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go onhome  the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at dartagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her	1165.5518
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation	692.0450
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	851.4633
i require honorable guaranties  i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guaranty	2195.4417
four days replied his friend are necessary to reach blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to paris	673.3082
to saddle gentlemen	739.9758
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	856.4572
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience  aw said lord wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain	887.4689
come let us see what you will do for me  everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply	392.6123
porthos opened his mouth to reply dartagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	855.7811
nor was this all	170.7603
ah thought the gascon he looks displeased	1208.2061
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears	391.3940
some wine said athos on perceiving the host	615.9964
and we did not surrenderno	1865.0054
this news was brought to us	538.2060
where is there any to be found  i can show you answered the gascon	374.7961
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning	1440.4891
 we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name	1081.4678
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dants did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose	922.4059
dartagnan rushed out of the room	334.0248
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you  i pledge you my word madam said the abb that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly  ah thats all very fine retorted the woman	543.6805
and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place  my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret	722.4191
but i will take the left handit is my custom in such circumstances	742.7317
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree	669.7938
have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles	518.2240
oh cried mme	1511.2307
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours	573.5416
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m de villefort	551.6356
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time  however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison  no sir not at this moment at least  sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	245.0932
the sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean	1672.6091
ho there champenois	1053.7858
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible	1103.9053
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	536.1346
yes indeed cried dartagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him yes surely he said  he said resumed porthos	636.5718
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve	742.5579
ah its all one said the host i have lost two customers but this one remains of whom i am pretty certain for some days to come	511.2745
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs	605.4298
my lord one last favor  what	1024.7576
why did you not say so at once my dear sir	375.8940
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again  why said dants if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me	606.4543
he held out his hand	596.0688
dartagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense	711.9791
what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall i ring	407.0490
i am not your uncle i know you not  my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in londonyou dare not	782.6857
the road to picardy	690.8528
people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it  porthos arrived a minute after dartagnan	382.2664
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire  that is to say replied dartagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it	568.7308

i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king	451.6036

well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths  this last explanation was wholly lost upon dants who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth	752.1188

from that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet  the abb uttered a kind of groan	438.7198
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have  the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes	539.5597

all i have is at his service  the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse  yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service  gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest	416.0062

the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	1153.3956
touching unanimity cried dartagnan which well becomes good citizens like us	791.3479
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine	872.7260
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles	925.1545

the fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos	955.3978
and here madame i must add another word of explanation	1064.6849
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure	701.8592
richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him  but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends	1273.8606
the next morning at nine oclock he entered franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fte days	1517.3597
who would ever have thought it  dartagnan only sighed	736.9626
dartagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts	1626.5579
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him	835.3895
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door	576.8287
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing	875.4490
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	1180.5815
and now good night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	665.5811
arrest the prime minister of king charles i	757.1136

i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it	770.7953
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head	344.3290
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive  dants raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet	553.5082
to be imprisoned	2155.4719
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him	553.2303
so you suppose i have need of an escort	500.9969
i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars	2205.2571
his whiskers cut off noirtier gave another turn to his hair took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and high buttoned frock coat a coat of villeforts of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his sons which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics	407.1280
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton	1224.8109
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them	780.2848
on y va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms	453.5661
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word	1003.1727
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st laurence on his gridiron	1205.7062
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin	728.4320
no a more material interest stirred his blood	2287.1868
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefittherefore he has gone and i am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating tone	301.9839
amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valrien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans	872.2664
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron dpinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	452.7447
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all	271.4848
did she stay long there  an hour and a half  did she return home  directly  well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy  bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening	785.2340
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession  you gave de wardes a meeting on thursday last in this very room did you not  no no	1429.0909
go  the lackey bowed to the ground and departed	472.4358
the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with teresa in his arms	975.9440
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugnie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty	1092.5692
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad augury	580.7383
have the goodness to send mine to athoss residence	1120.6820
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent	771.5882
we want money for our return to paris  i am much attached to that horse athos  and there again you are wrong	447.3288
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	1293.5731
now said planchet let us thank the queen	652.4045
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist	883.7692
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	1960.8958
fly then cried mademoiselle darmilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished fly  or kill yourself said eugnie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary	1806.8728
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer	756.3276
monsieur i love men of your kidney and i foresee plainly that if we dont kill each other i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation	801.8641
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle	860.2534
no no it is as i have said maximilianthere is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpseno support to cling to but my mother in heaven  i see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today  i feel the same as regards yourself said valentine and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give me  i have another replied maximilian but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first  so much the worse said valentine smiling	373.7198
i hear she said that paris is not quiet	559.3727
this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple  and at the third she expired  at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion  yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone  what are you going to say	866.0521
cromwells house	867.8111

the count came towards him	704.8777
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address	379.5284

i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	272.8704
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chausse dantin to m danglars	344.6400
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone	1283.8346
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events	1552.7504
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy  but why must you leave me so soon  i do not know particulars	818.9122
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep	1123.1053
that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with troops	530.6313
he found a young shepherd watching his flock	1982.3790
why about ten or eleven oclock  shall we watch by the corpse  of what use would it be	648.9036
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of oak	429.8370
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot  are you well fed repeated the inspector	432.0019
you are placed on high my lord but tremble	940.9257
de saint mran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault	905.0844
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited dartagnans reply	848.4135
chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking	989.4315
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	572.7570
but do not be alarmed on her account	601.5599
how do you know it is the doctor asked valentine astonished	421.1979
well	40.8289
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him	683.5344
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven  then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice	528.0681
yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it	733.4226
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his purse	882.0006
according to the counts directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against a tree	663.1462
i am cold sir said mousqueton	1033.6527
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne  and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon  perhaps returned the count smiling	298.0958
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal  my friend the cardinal cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed	523.0919
if you can my dear dartagnan answer for mademoiselle  oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris  then said aramis this falls out very well  he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty	552.2483
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free agents  alas exclaimed mercds if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair  monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief	453.4698
still further in buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme	2078.5667
valery but listen	1081.2800
i have lent him to a friend  who will understand the signs he makes returned dartagnan	454.2354
then i believe you	200.4899
well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately  why what is the matter  it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all	372.4975
is that what you wish for said barrois	328.9146
do you desire it as ardently as you say  yes  well then you shall have it  the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips	421.3674
gumen was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts	421.4604
a prisoner he reiterated	639.0830
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner	1374.3206
god keep me from it my dear monsieur mordaunt	575.9736
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	1520.0275
ah m andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone how do you do  charmingly as you see	679.2458
all has gone according to my wishes	928.7264
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me  alas alas what a fearful extremity  valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother  i would rather die a hundred timesoh yes die  no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope  i will think of maximilian  you are my own darling child valentine	376.0332
hold	40.2477
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed	591.4482
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond  said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager	323.8257
yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	501.5110
above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird	1344.4881
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	561.3583
why what good would it do asked caderousse	513.9331
to dinner said dartagnan	563.9321
at madame de villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes	2211.5745
the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy and will make one large quarto volume  and on what have you written all this  on two of my shirts	708.2723
and you are not afraid of that athos  no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear  now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear  nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest  and with regard to the past asked porthos	223.3347
how said bonacieux astonished	1416.5532
cannot monsieur cromwell wait a little  yes but i said mordaunt	580.7569
yet i think i hear her piano  it is mademoiselle louise darmilly who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in bed  well said madame danglars come and undress me  they entered the bedroom	873.1514
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king	359.9135
he is a coward  with women perhaps but not with men	477.2026
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances	754.0468
i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive	460.4835
i have a son	305.9450
then i saw no more but i heard the noise of breaking furniture	528.9221
ah	16.8552
i should think so but not without difficulty	627.2414
before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion	1214.4424
chapter 109 the assizes  the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation	693.1874
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care  and what is her name  hayde replied monte cristo	720.6118
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme	640.0333
lack a day	231.3885
he had received in the chest the bullet of dartagnans first adversary	865.1960
one of them recognized him	327.1400
could you ever have credited such a thing my dear danglars asked m morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dants from m de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse	434.7338
they descended into the plain by the ladder	799.8047
alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined	679.4710
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence  i do not understand stammered lucien	819.0950
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself	849.0004
whip	39.1368
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar	558.6307
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew him	388.7681
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction	465.1579
hallo continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond	1324.0536
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters hand  mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain	728.9087
well this man	265.8208
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here  he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality  by the way m de chteau renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel  ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him	389.7662
listen	82.7721
i saw madame de saint mran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said chteau renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	1313.9978
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark	1050.4315
i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by	331.8106
m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	659.6927
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal	494.9233
and what makes me all the more wretched sir is that i was the cause of this misfortune  how so asked athos	329.0728
well asked the two gendarmes	663.3710
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property  no unfortunately but when i do obtain it  well  i shall remember old friends i can tell you that  yes since you have such a good memory  what do you want	697.3882
what do you mean by that you idiot asked dartagnan	504.4318
to answer you would be to forget it	358.9762
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming  i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped  i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry	375.6474
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each	919.4243
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	962.1136
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1f3 this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	1213.7992
the time of the carnival was at hand	261.5679
she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre	683.0613
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me  no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming  and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	224.7506
good morning lucien good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me	2271.4771
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos	641.5057
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	1225.7307
i resisted	748.5198
of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are mademoiselle eugnie danglars and mademoiselle louise darmilly	515.5702
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance  mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced dartagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself	1785.2909
ah yes we burn as they say at the game of pincette	889.8796
but what happened after my departure  how can i tell said kitty	842.5995
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun	657.1517
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifes having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt	930.5860
alas i have them no longer  how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity  it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son  well let us see said mazarin isnt there still time to repair the evil	339.9350
chapter 2 father and son  we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dants who after having traversed la canebire took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the alles de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room	1366.5487

and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner  the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons  oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strangethe father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics	345.6045

at the mention of monte cristo dants started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca	632.5794

already up raoul exclaimed the count	767.8242
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountaintheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result  well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m dpinay into personal contact	644.5013

gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter  i can my lord said raoul	412.8450
dartagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but athos raised his hand	1099.8186

as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him  consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you  i know monsieur le cur said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you  and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cur told me it was just now  i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me  and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho  i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that  ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades  i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them  ifaith exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le cur can answer for you  i answer for him said the curate	800.4759
i was promised he should die with me	416.2021

with a word dartagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal	609.8772
dartagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady	524.8915

mademoiselle eugnie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel	1687.5469
lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose	1101.3312
debray inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic life	667.0441
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants  but how is it that you know so much of these matters  i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account  ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men  my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you  who is it  it is monsieur dartagnan  that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise	425.1241

really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness  what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	500.8316

the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts	475.8073

it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres  yes  to whom do you desire to leave this fortune  oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	482.6440
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property	396.7559

but wait a minute said m de trville stopping him	1040.1837

on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said porthos	829.1221
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	751.1335
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant	1532.7537

he made a sign which i understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard	614.7391
yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return  you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her  and what said the abb asked athos	695.4234

what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection  an abdication repeated anne i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated  well replied mazarin and am i not almost a kingking indeed of france	1370.8810
now gentlemen said dartagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire  the englishmen bowed and went upstairs	359.4500

in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs	1184.7576
yes he is a terrible antagonist	703.3400
a paltry piece of business murmured dartagnan crumpling his note	1388.1477

to the wall to the wall  and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch	572.4580
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout	1988.5546
when dartagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve oclock was striking	758.0648

you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange	610.4070

i have happily only myself in the world to care for  but what makes you sigh  my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy  you are not happy porthos	602.1649
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then  my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said dartagnan	1870.8733
dartagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return	451.4346
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen	2138.8848
let us talk like men he said looking at the count	412.4916
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known	385.7402

what think you of it inquired athos	301.4294
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing  hush said athos we are overheard  in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	732.1032
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary	612.6333

on the sixth day the smugglers returned	1147.0033
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m de villefort  in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the kings attorney	749.4999
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished  is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father  very well you are always the same athos great and generous	559.9011
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques  the affair in the rue saint jacques exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation	606.4541
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly	784.8746

oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy  with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the childs lips	823.6861
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur asked monte cristo	708.5992
however he like csar borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard	1151.7140
how much do you want  all you have in gold  i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts  i have as much	505.6202

and i du barthois added porthos	952.1891
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged usthe comte de la fere and monsieur du vallonto accompany him	1553.5139

and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina	606.9117
they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do  two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleansthat he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned	992.9744
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything  there was a brief silence the abb rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	1030.8569
adieu	98.8960
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride	687.8539
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you  dartagnan became more and more astonished	662.1752
one of marie michons adventures	499.1390

i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable  it is mere want of occupation	792.1432
upon gaining this advantage dartagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman	713.1486
my nephew is not yet king and you know laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything  then let us pray to heaven said the girl	509.2831
no indeed cried dartagnan	774.8035
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the threenone other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed  put her to torture and shell soon tell us where her money is  it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling	507.3765

shivering for want of a fagot	944.5048
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party  and what is the origin of this name  it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slingingqui frondentstones from the moats round paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned	503.2720
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort levque	729.1103
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four  gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best  what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	654.7474
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains	630.5541
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired	680.4466

but this is droll cried dartagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter	1113.1693
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp	957.3432
but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded	1222.9282
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition	403.7365

the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous	646.8859
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me  come now said athos you are joking  in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said  i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements  no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences  poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal  come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair  perhaps you speak the truth aramis  well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	426.1584
remained alone and turning his eyes on his half opened horace muttered  justum et tenacem propositi virum  m de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	734.4845
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected	527.8525
see look at fernand and follow his example he is well behaved  0051m    fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercds smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	809.6604
i could defy a nation  be quiet porthos said dartagnan we are observed  we are admired ifaith answered porthos	1700.6454
he turned up a king	453.4402
dartagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart	490.0459
the devil murmured dartagnan all this is vague enough	1216.5997
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert	772.9694
i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutteryes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together  the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to dartagnan i was not speaking to you sir  but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn	1003.7445
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned	1136.5015

de montbazon and mme	2315.8374
first m and madame de saint mran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirthree drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretchhe therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest  why what nonsense are you telling us said chteau renaud	2238.0662
ah you are awake madame he said then i have nothing more to do here	312.5585
in addition to this dartagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de trville he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes dchausss or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren fieldsan accessory to the preaux clercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose	984.9684
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl	1072.1730
but have the kindness to give the abb busoni  i told you he was not at home repeated the valet	409.3220
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter  oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied madame danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you	563.5237

i waited for him until this hour replied franz	813.0063
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to dartagnans face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king	1035.4513
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information  sir replied the mayor	872.6624
i love you as one loves a father brother husband	709.7879
no said felton it is nothing  but what then is the noise  that of the patrol going their rounds  where is their road  just under us  they will discover us  no if it does not lighten  but they will run against the bottom of the ladder  fortunately it is too short by six feet  here they are	451.8696
dartagnan translated this for the others	989.9464
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door	243.6809
you said just now that you had a hundred friends  very true but you introduced me at m danglars  not at all	384.2018
the antechamber of m de trville   m de troisville as his family was still called in gascony or m de trville as he has ended by styling himself in paris had really commenced life as dartagnan now did that is to say without a sou in his pocket but with a fund of audacity shrewdness and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his	949.9261
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal  but who then is this assassin this murderer  let me also ask you a question	1291.6155
why people jest with death  and people are wrong dartagnan for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation  granted but if you please let us not theologize aramis	865.6731

have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen  yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds  well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm  well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor i tell you you must not count on monsieur dartagnan  it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm  seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall	930.3238
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	339.8183
i have but one portmanteau  i dare say you have nothing else with you	522.0085
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew	282.4001

my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father  it is well returned the voice tomorrow  these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dants rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall	669.0622
yes happy as myself said he	421.4486
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	580.3095
in this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be killed	640.6079
dartagnan concealed himself in his closet milady called undressed sent away kitty and shut the door	1263.2689
it is he cried bonacieux	398.2791
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy	992.1234
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it  is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort	1170.8988
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance  and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat incredulously	1656.0538
speak not of it reverend sir	439.0471
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle  my dear dherblayi learned from dartagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord	1495.1642
with your lasso you could stop an ox  again ali repeated his affirmative gesture	719.4258
the others followed	567.8530
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years  nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times	908.3928
pity me	168.8848
ah you fellows are good managers	2326.8721
under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without assistance  really captain said dartagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french	1547.8447
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian	417.9901
how asked blaisois i can	845.5569
but was it my fathers ring	160.1260
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of bthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to	1350.7195
it is a false diamond said caderousse	777.5581
monsieur dartagnan he cried falling back a step it is monsieur dartagnan	471.0649
but where is franz  in the first carriage with m de villefort who considers him already as one of the family  40024m    such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m davrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m de villefort	372.8213
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots	387.8991
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs	448.7416
i beg you to do so  i beg you to excuse me madame i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken  mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken	330.4422
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your fathers favor and that i might do him justice	446.5250
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance	1099.5529
but after his bath asked morcerf	1688.1609
valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner  valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking	458.5785
no one could be seen or heard	501.8397
splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room	1207.6174
they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered	581.4828
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	1017.7094
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account  you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man	537.8917
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles  take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments  the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey	1049.6045
but continued aramis the details escape me  and me also said porthos	460.7334
ah	35.6324
ah if i knew	427.3461
and they separated with courteous gestures	298.7093
sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london	637.0485
we have had a narrow escape  but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son	1196.9812
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers	1172.2368
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs  you guess well  i know something of diamonds i have had some  you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	869.0480
exactly like me	333.6301
really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him  yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort  indeed  30115m    and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing	783.2087
when he came within hearing he exclaimed  i am pursued can you conceal me  they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former	706.0750
to be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastardthat is he can be  do not say that debray returned beauchamp laughing for here is chteau renaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of renaud de montauban his ancestor through your body  he will sully it then returned lucien for i am lowvery low  oh heavens cried beauchamp the minister quotes branger what shall we come to next  m	824.4767
dartagnan then only half lied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance	580.8867
he is worse than thathe is a devil returned the turnkey	1212.2502
do not charge a fee for access to viewing displaying performing copying or distributing any project gutenberg works unless you comply with paragraph 1e8 or 1e9	299.1915
then three or four shots were fired	2006.2460
i monseigneur replied milady	1662.4410
what papers  the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your childs birth  the register of my childs birth  the register of the birth of andrea cavalcantiof your son is not his name andrea  i believe so said the major	1483.7573
this time dartagnan was not hasty	498.3329
dartagnan ejaculated athos	203.8258
speak  he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guardsan appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers  tis the appointment monsieur de trville held you ask of me  the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de trville has left it it has not been filled  but it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household  monsieur de trville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years  you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed	1135.5962
dartagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head  see dear friend what it is to belong to the army	557.5271
the parliament	1455.1260
i love to see you thus	333.6632
i have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot	2341.3042
m morrel was seated at his right hand danglars at his left while at a sign from edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable	477.1350
are you not married asked the countess	498.7145
we have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him  porthos is wounded then  i cannot tell you monsieur  what	839.0579
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort	368.8243
light me m bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to  monsieur replied bertuccio it leads to the garden  and pray how do you know that  it ought to do so at least  well let us be sure of that  bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden	646.3676
hes a gascon	456.4244
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	1520.0536
the chancellor made a profound reverence	278.9770
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage	2002.8030
i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres  good god cried she two thousand livres	932.8362
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler	621.6180
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with chteau renaud and beauchamp	762.8996
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	1581.8475
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you  if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort	619.7408
send me the keeper of the seals sguier  and that man what has your eminence done with him  what man asked the cardinal	478.1100
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you  why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the stranger	900.0593
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood  and he said nothing as he died  yes he exclaimed oh  i suppose answered dartagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much  well sir cried the queen	329.4326
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak	735.1592
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell	334.3271
m davrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind	1049.1846
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	553.9153
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	590.9633
yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again  30309m    never  never  i never returned to the country where she lived  to malta  yes malta  she is then now at malta  i think so  and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer  heryes  but only her do you then still hate those who separated you  i hate them	998.5377
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	551.6206
dants was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless	345.0198
count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own  maximilian you know i have no relation in the world	313.1358
and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man	484.4452
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said	1057.6227
the pope awaited him	248.3412
dartagnan was a woman and still more a mother	265.1468
long live the coadjutor cried the crowd	691.8889
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses	528.2007
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me	1026.4272
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine	806.3607
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse	455.3831
mazarin	42.3173
still you must breakfast somewhere  but if i am not hungry said the young man	479.4092
and now my good friend said dartagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak  the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man dartagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets	426.8810
will you let me be killed	364.1990
in the name of heaven my lord cried mme	439.0146
oh youll know it someday aramis but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctors niece  aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening	1677.3735
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone  and dartagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy	488.3906
chapter lxxxiii	353.0085
but dont let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your masters orders	1891.2042
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence	706.9958
not a step forward or youre dead men  stuff cried porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit	242.5414
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name	914.2219
do you not recognize me unhappy child  silencebe silent said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for heavens sake do not speak so loud  you wish to speak with me alone do you not said bertuccio	1767.0656
but is not your eminence going to the queen  for what purpose  monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army  it is well i will go  comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related	673.8212
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him	642.3585
i have another commission for you m bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandyfor instance between le havre and boulogne	718.3005
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws	2263.8518
well	87.4617
if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand  20211m    well said the count turning towards franz i told you there was some mistake in this  are you not alone asked vampa with uneasiness	242.4619
with two companions he said	404.6194
it was about five oclock	722.1325
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man	361.2813
it is thisi swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the 5th of february 1815 between nine and ten oclock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did	611.9017
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell said mazarin	1150.9607
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly	554.7194
the cardinal seemed furious	991.5892
ive remarked that your puritans revel in that color  but can you find your man said aramis to athos	705.4130

bonacieux	95.0541
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you  thats well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him trville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him	318.7926
you have a sad air  alas said dartagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate  tell me  presently said dartagnan	584.1436
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed  yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described	742.8132

their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on alberts account ceased instantly	1612.7836
do you not comprehend  no  the chteau dif has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirty six pound cannon ball to their feet  well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension	805.7161
indeed indeed i did not  a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast	1124.2070
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de trvillethe counsels being thrown into the bargain	1022.0980
you say she is in a convent replied porthos	370.0996
why on board the tartan replied the sailor	862.4787
it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal monsieur de trville must think us dead  to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army	314.8767
you have had three horses foundered or killed he asked me	879.7299
it seems to me said dartagnan with a thousand livres eachi do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator  this word procurator roused porthos	565.4831
it was porthos	227.6070
dartagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de trville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens	525.1171
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied	906.0910
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name	489.8711
besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before  do not mistake	486.9818
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	930.3570
your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words	1204.9415
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts chasseur also	918.6547
you are about to become captain at nineteenan elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone  you are right you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them  you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you	1471.4197
be civil or i shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones rank  you dont choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned dartagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name  enough	2037.9156
yes you were thinking of it and with justice	275.5150
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	909.0840
athos porthos and aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much pleased	851.8409
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind	1638.2875
i have known you four days i have loved him four years	612.0724
will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp	740.2027
then gloom settled heavily upon him	105.8813
who	12.9985
here is the paper do you know the writing as he spoke villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to dants	313.4653
he reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine	343.4222
oh	27.3295
a change  indeed said albert	1264.2216
dartagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	1098.2135
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lessongod forgive me  wait a little aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor  let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said aramis	728.8975
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret	688.0800
we are not generally very severe with the austrians	1119.3634

the door yielded	57.4141
poor man he is a worthy creature he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant	643.1882
no replied the young man	205.4724
come exclaimed aramis	1254.0695
you see your friends are wakeful	1432.0481
run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here  the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands cries	542.9854
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude	737.7196
the count received him with his habitual smile	840.3284
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers bed	956.1780
well asked he	238.2849
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise	478.7771

i who am going to give you another piece of good advice  what is it  to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger	353.6267
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	1395.1364
we dont know the locality and shall never find the wall	794.1746
the memory of richelieu annihilates me	1306.1599
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	578.1687
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and iat least i understood it so  when will it be our turn to think of these things	624.4894
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of men	483.8508

say my highness is furious	1395.5250
an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii	952.0289
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer  perhaps you like repose she said	720.7176
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects	374.2597
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense	1364.3578
we have the first throw  ha	1185.6725

then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered	1223.1686
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him	583.5684
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools	538.8400

oh yes it is you indeed	266.4760
my faith replied dartagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts  in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward dartagnan stood quite astonished	811.4560

bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedettos name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so	1304.8052
every door was opened to him	219.5869
sir said the cardinal you have heard me	172.1926

in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams	777.0425

my father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us	1234.7517
how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear frienda friend lost to him forever and on his death bed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were maximilian it was edmond dants  at these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilianmadame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment	1365.0320
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	556.2466

m de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair	982.8797
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone	562.7375

ah perbacco indispensable were they  certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child  true said the major there might be doubts raised  in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated  it would be fatal to his interests  it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance  o peccato  you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity  that is the misfortune	1865.8931

in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of st bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsla rochelle is impregnable except to famine	774.0098

who and what are you demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hours time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim	804.1877

it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercds sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	849.5150

at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain	698.1319

ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform  and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m danglars said  baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugnie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf  but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said  monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer  to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us  count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them  i do not understand you baron said morcerf	350.3249
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed	706.3023
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people	700.4707
planchet had no need to learn more	685.5376
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my paywhich i am never paid by the wayto make the king five years older  really	690.9773
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	1712.2863

it is his son  dartagnans arm dropped to his side	788.4648
everyone must live  certainly go on  i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself	713.6956
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i dont believe in them  the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos  at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemenan affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained  how is that cried porthos and aramis in a breath	478.5317
planchet and bazin came last	981.0760
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	494.5039
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingthat will signify but little that concerns god you and myself  mercds said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m de morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy  i perceive what you are intending to propose to me but i cannot accept it edmondmy son would not permit it  nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf	2189.5652
this was the more so because bonacieuxs reflections were all rose colored	1521.6505
1e4	27.7072
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i cannot throw you out of window for three weeksthat is to say for twenty four days to comenor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed	743.0870
oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather inviting  what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago	848.8400
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her	471.6212
athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw	680.7020
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her	339.3605
poor things	1264.8263

if i am killedwell then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes  it is well replied mercds with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion  but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy	754.2838
i am well i want nothing do not call him  she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room	1077.1124
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean  he went to find aramis	409.2466
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea you love me  yes i do or may the devil take me	592.7752
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am he said to himself	363.9738

in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides	769.7066
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin  i hope so  and when will the dance begin  the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until to morrow morning  you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier dhumieres has promised me whenever i need them  upon fifty soldiers  yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them  good my dear rochefort but that is not all	398.5709
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen	750.9445
you are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear dartagnan	524.4717
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	509.8792
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	1218.5971
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way	655.4181
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows	1097.1956
bravo planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master i will promise you a place in my service  oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur dartagnan  at the same time dartagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand	394.5341
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations	2422.0217
counting his treasures replied the governor	856.5829
his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance	2173.3298
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words  oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature	1162.9341
there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal from harlequin even to pantaloon  chevalier	2017.2257
well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly	364.7711

we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest	2007.2909
i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going  where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt  let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz	543.1615
descend my lord said the man in the moat	244.3445
i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristoand certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses	562.0182
hold	50.6352
then he thought he was going to die	280.6122

the messenger resisted my brother killed him  oh said mme	1864.8773
louis xiv	1154.6091
no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital  andrea scowled	2333.5278
say when shall it be	295.4285
do you possess 400000 francs inquired the notary	2024.2338
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation	689.9149
i asked you continued villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in law m de saint mran my mother in law madame de saint mran barrois and my daughter valentine  ah sir exclaimed madame de villefort clasping her hands what do you say  it is not for you to interrogate but to answer  is it to the judge or to the husband stammered madame de villefort	501.3363
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the varits i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear  but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free  who will tell her  the first person who sees her  she only speaks romaic  that is different  but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes  oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far	2332.1753
dartagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility	2099.2361
you at marseillesyes says he	1434.8397
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation	536.2752
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head	869.6674
marry forsooth people dont die of hunger here  and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window	893.2578
and he made the same friendly salute as dartagnan	715.4770
athos smiled	1081.3263
have you not let it go out of your hands  no  davrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them	496.5686
dants rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	1087.8143
oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him  in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper	657.0643
fie  dartagnan dartagnan cried aramis you are killing me  well here it is at last said dartagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket	398.2362
dartagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	739.8942
oh the devil	282.3216
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother	992.5616
the jailer therefore only grumbled	1482.5600
oh do not fear the scaffold madame said the magistrate i will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself no if you have heard me distinctly you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold  no i do not understand what do you mean stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed	533.2451
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	317.4355
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat	509.6344
look  that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lackey  in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to him	944.1649
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but  have you only two days of leave raoul  on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go  where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret	319.4369
with the aid of his pickaxe dants after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	1142.5566
good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him	740.2906
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen  and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked dartagnan	465.5604
i have resolved to fly with you not a wordbe ready	748.1013
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father	607.5314
there is no doubt of that	210.1101
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers	710.5790
the figure put the comb in its pocket	1648.0785
that is impossible replied the governor	501.3475
is it large  middling  how is it arranged  faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan  they are all here said caderousse briskly	1245.4036
thank you madame i am aware of them now monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head  the cardinal cried mme	452.0936
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank	405.1609
unfortunately i didnt crush him flat	1047.0948
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five oclock  was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one muttered dartagnan	304.8700
her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her brow	2408.5688
well then madame yes i did feel fear and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i cannot count how many charges and skirmishes i own for the third time in my life i was afraid	848.7853
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper	693.0555
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands	778.9926
but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him	923.8589
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty	1612.0094
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table	618.7651
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me	901.8168
when all had gone out and the door was closed m de trville on turning round found himself alone with the young man	517.0445
as to m de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past	377.0872
in the proper time and place i will remember everything	570.9611
well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea  really exclaimed the englishman	781.6522
who is that swiss asked dartagnan	493.7945
miladys secret   dartagnan left the htel instead of going up at once to kittys chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to doand that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this woman	939.7998
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	1105.9301
dartagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the sheath	716.8323
oh no athos	433.0135
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	428.6850
i inherit my fathers name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it	1781.9247
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child  everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead	662.8885
let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings horse	455.1816
you can sleep here  yes do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you  no i must sleep at beaucaire	1094.5769
you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see  athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about dartagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it	484.1711
if you be a priest i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man if you be not it is a different matter and i warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that i shall chastise you for your insolence  the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult	374.4934
in one hour after the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with letters	1078.0964
yes said chteau renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed  you are fastidious chteau renaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and quite new  that is just what i find fault with	2021.4875

prince cavalcanti said the latter prince cavalcanti where are you  andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name	968.9006
yes read it  50281m    morrel opened the letter and read  my dear maximilian  there is a felucca for you at anchor	572.1613
the people who wrote are anglo germans you know  oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts  is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	1161.7845
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come beauchamp and chteau renaud exchanged looks of astonishment	1125.3274
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly	1454.5170
just god he muttered whence comes this thought	1566.0507
you are acquainted with the young viscount are you  we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome  true true cried danglars	715.6874
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything  however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act	770.9096
he caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud  of whom i bought her said monte cristo as i told you albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills  oh you are good you are great my lord said hayde kissing the counts hand and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master  albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard	788.6182
albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the counts kindness	1436.3641
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government  mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondys suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression  madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinals hat seems to belong already to his noble brow  ah	485.6414

i am the most wretched of men	444.3349

hol bazin	1302.7001
the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground	612.0867
my sword	2442.3767
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody elses	897.5012
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions  could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend	549.8430
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared	1697.1815
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip	616.1574
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there	470.0539
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic	647.3876
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk  but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced  touch it not  grimaud he cried grimaud	531.7785
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos	562.3942
the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once	635.3088
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort	1073.0154
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case	585.5656
0145m    no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon  but you have seen him  sire i went straight to the duc de blacas  but you will see him then  i think not sire  ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive i forgot you and m noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed  sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for  never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy	698.3193
it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather frenchwomanfor i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned her  that ring comes from milady cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion	1226.9609
mme	72.6064
he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to comedeeds and power which none could thwart with impunity	1044.7714
you cannot imagine mother how beautiful i think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love	884.8938
bonacieux we must have them back again  yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am i to act	469.7588
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that right	1140.9658
as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness	1176.9927
count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours  if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort	381.3600
oh	86.6280
he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul  raoul cried athos	1989.6217
you  yes  you have them  i have them  ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48000 francsah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them  i do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the abb busoni thought for you  he is an excellent person  he is extremely prudent and thoughtful  he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you  here they are  the major clasped his hands in token of admiration	366.3652

he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish	1478.4061
after a moments silence the lady inquired  do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium	352.7141
i shall retire and die tranquillyat home  for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron  you shall be one  and have you not seen any of our other friends  yes i have seen aramis  and what does he wish	692.3955

to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille  let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening	723.5826

a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy  come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her  her  20183m    the beautiful greek of yesterday  no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible  when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains  where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	670.8659
i believe not	495.0284
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled	1169.8000

0315m    still dants could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dants coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation	899.8992
he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered	1480.9321
what forthat they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whomm	1678.0006
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement	1194.0195
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt  ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt  my faith yes said dartagnan	582.7330
i will not forget you	389.9164
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers  the countess made no reply	621.5795
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me  my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune  it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud	594.0312
a moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember  he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow	896.0717
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain	644.4432
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	1950.3464
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people	473.1394
my mind was already made up	710.8443
no more edicts no more of the cardinals guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds	1998.2994
dartagnan looked at porthos	505.7641
i left five hundred with assunta my sister in law and with the other five hundred i set off for nmes	639.8530
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect  a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis	453.9399

planchet	78.1114
yes  well read the letter again	562.2844
that day the ministers clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor	771.7750

let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it	398.3078

and alexander vi	1466.7976
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry	392.5826
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower beds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinire with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure	835.2170
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart	805.8333
i tried to speak	696.7859

morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archology mineralogy and natural history	494.2196
they went to find porthos and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a horse	576.1228
you will not be pitiless cried mordaunt	1328.9506
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	341.9292
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian	525.8134
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos	574.9440

the cicerone reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman	667.0181
if you do not come across one return for me the patron shook his head	533.4895
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	1602.5457
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene	2093.4741

before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution  well then i will content myself with arresting you  madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament  it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and delbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him  your pardon madame i know all that	448.8987

providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner	715.2089
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed	1216.0469
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped  but athos cried dartagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he  as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty	340.6004
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the htel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gata as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended	515.9387
raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand	704.5122
oh yes	680.1421
sir  my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you  i make a hasty resolution said morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey  50125m    maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed	792.9834
well	87.8671
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge	723.1263
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing	632.2621
bonacieux the comtesse de winter  the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the rest	512.8802
the next morning dartagnan ran to find athos	876.9815
ah he cried by jove	763.5518
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival	527.3082
it would be very kind of you  no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter  a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be  are we alone  yes replied the count going to the door and returning	274.8466
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued dartagnan with his frank expression	517.2531
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dants sank again into his seat	1461.1293
in one case or the other the trial was soon over	424.0605
the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugnies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection	802.7606
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women	1087.0396
devil take the vain fellow said dartagnan	562.7169
bonacieux and that the man was aramis	107.7275
down there you always had little presents and christmas boxes which you tried to hide from your poor friend caderousse	1150.6682
help cried dartagnan	446.3395
0295m    it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	490.4176
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	559.7682
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired	1062.2235
do not refuse this little service	1268.2036
oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in love  you know what it is to be in love said dartagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention	204.8754
rich	39.8419

who goes there	871.6375
the lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in advance	1183.2626
do you understand me  perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not  the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value  thank you	492.3086
frequenting the caf de paris the boulevard de gand and the bois de boulogne during his brief career of splendor the false cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances	1693.1520
i suspected where she was concealed	1266.3224
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal	411.0428
what have i said  you said that porthos had received a sword cut  yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so  and why so  zounds monsieur	352.7962
well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all  i think that matters look very gloomy madame  but what step would you propose to me  i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not  you may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid once  the chancellor reddened and stammered some words	336.8423
you cant imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is	598.3481
50203m    before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day  madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine	417.3822
bonacieux the one he had just picked up	414.9099
tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the morning	1323.2887
monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis  monsieur darminges said de guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible	837.2599
who the beggar was that i killed  ah	436.0689
and then there are robbers said la carconte	1245.6233
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book	1507.7772
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	472.0660
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	559.3789
hayde still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in arabic	538.9096
you are irritated and vexedtell me how this fernand is related to you  he is merely my father said albertm	917.0642
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn	2196.4448
have you lost your heart  indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valre reply to alceste21 at the thtre franais	490.5562
and you did not tell him that you came from me  no sir  at ten oclock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter	401.0657
master broussel is being killed	1798.9894
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the kings room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of dartagnan and porthos	496.2931
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars	411.4124
chapter liii	847.3671
come in said franz	273.2758
i am a physiognomist i assure you  dartagnan went out first as had been agreed upon	679.1193
thats all that is necessary said athos now for my idea  i should like however to comprehend said porthos	417.1951
impossible  they appear to be numerous  then tis something else  another horse said porthos	1080.3438
what orders asked milady	1763.1190
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth	955.7126
this evening m coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for him	521.9047
as to the duc de bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the duc delbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff	535.7203
what is the matter asked milady	391.9614
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abb  count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me  alas continued athos the poor abb was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature  monsieur cried the duchess seizing athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you  athos laughed	469.1454
it must have been charming indeed	954.6573
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder	468.9474
i carried the infection of crime with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague	575.7855
as dartagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and short	1856.7593
i	56.6815
keep up the dance then since he will have it so	415.9918
die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution  then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan	1843.0823
let us sell the diamond	981.6965
well what is the matter asked the young lieutenant	340.7498
to morrow the army of paris will be summoned the day after it will be here	454.8453

he had friends then after five years in prison	720.5891
yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage	285.6202
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous  the blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his mind	1133.7468
the thin spare man  yes  the executioner in short asked aramis	1196.1622
i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel  son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month	558.9109
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips	566.9256
are you ambitious	1317.4397
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarrons pension  that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	1739.1737
troops  five or six thousand men  courage  plenty  then the thing is easy	1289.2010
i supplicate you i implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver  hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself	981.3704
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated chteau renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other	656.9203
i bitterly reproach myself i assure you  well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips	975.5899
i know it and the duke put the quill to the paper	323.7983
escape   as lord de winter had thought miladys wound was not dangerous	847.9909
20185m    gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable	1471.0676
think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you  i offer you a beggar my lord  ah	768.8784
i will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency  and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors	388.2883
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies	369.3230
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness	745.3095
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her	641.9500
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall	1117.7020
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise dartagnans vigilance	1970.4066
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play	476.3257
cocles went first and the stranger followed him	424.6147
it was the king speaking on the scaffold	308.4934
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no	673.8912
have you any letters for me inquired dartagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief	812.5548
that great giant who was there gave it to him  in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick  so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins  and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him  to be sure the coadjutor has promised  who told you that  monsieur maillard himself  you have seen him then  certainly i was there when he fell  what were you doing there  i was shouting down with mazarin death to the cardinal the italian to the gallows isnt that what you would have me shout  be quiet you rascal said bazin looking uneasily around	618.9688
 a sacerdotal officer	155.4367
you have credit with your landlord then asked porthos	903.5618
yes said the queen but his son  his son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother is  and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville  no madame for i presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of normandy  as to the government of normandy replied the queen i think i can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers  we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together  what next  what next madame  yes  that is all  havent you then a fourth companion  yes madame the comte de la fere  what does he ask  nothing  there is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asksnothing  there is the comte de la fere madame	350.2653
fire cried mordaunt fire upon them  three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound	1071.6562
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of  chapter xxxv	632.7486
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work there  and he advanced to the window	773.4702
never mind rene replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a womans nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love	1002.9321
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy	1831.5686
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished	1211.9502
pale and trembling milady repulsed dartagnans attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed	1338.4257
27 said the inspector	333.7146
ah	28.7422
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly	770.3749
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast  it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely	407.7767
richest my dear fellow  and dartagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket	618.0792
gentlemen said he m	185.6083
dartagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him	700.5589
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady	620.4513
the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china	1885.1367
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him  noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing	560.0955
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	1418.7178
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs	1010.4846
midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl	1083.5469
that is true said dartagnan let us call the others  they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis	444.6276
8 brucea ferruginea	551.6052
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one cant entertain	813.4104
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise	824.5247
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies	541.5018
parbleu thats good said albert with a gloomy tone	770.2261
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance  go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything  ma foi you frighten me	767.1769
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived	534.2810
i tremble to give my permission  listen valentine	1473.2648
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world	564.3974
is that monsieur said dartagnan to himself	181.1187
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know but added he seriously you understand it is on the kings service  at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one	649.4865
well sir said the abb you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon  unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me  he did not know said the abb	1239.1193
no door gave entrance to the room	486.3740
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles	1066.5315
open the gate he cried	255.2153
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	626.7015
and you say that monsieur dartagnan was one of those four men  he led the enterprise  and who were the others  i leave it to monsieur dartagnan to name them my lord	280.1590
come come my little fellow dont be angry	1258.3488
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs  it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abb as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper	1462.5520
grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm	799.0225
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches	1453.3641
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	1082.3954
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of henrietta maria	582.7233
the mind can see as well as the body	440.8252
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly  monsieur le vicomte has no sword  tis well said athos i will take care of that  they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent	982.5624
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop	488.0002
twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with promises	1088.3649
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and dartagnan a captain	289.7194
what has become of him	329.3720
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye	876.5493
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs but gentlemen i warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration people will come to the rescue  ah	828.9106
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped	469.0246
still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugnie danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make	785.0524
the felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves	872.9448
monte cristo shuddered and arose	1964.1075
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abb had himself paid to his house on the day of valentines death	394.3533
for the rest this vengeance was very easy for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself	961.3134
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing  ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syriewe will not go alone to the garden  then said mercds i will lead the way  turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm  the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercds	658.0157
i am finishing the most execrable mornings work  what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently  my papers thank god nomy papers are all in capital order because i have none but m cavalcantis  m	125.7025
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked dartagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england	744.5586
let me see what time it is  danglars watch one of breguets repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five	764.5201
god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you  ah i recognize youi recognize you exclaimed the kings attorney you are  i am edmond dants  you are edmond dants cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here  and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe	619.6403
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	400.5379
you are crazy	1157.7267
whitehall	33.8279
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end  ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent  this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing dartagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying  i am not calumniating you my friend	497.0157
i shall meet with a victim	678.7728
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him	1020.5450
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano  the prisoner started and bit his lips	764.5917
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month  and what did the doctor answer asked monte cristo	877.8802
ah said he they have sent some fencing master to fight with me the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound	854.5280
and i really dont know what prevents me from exterminating you all  alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see	925.8792
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs	679.4875
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring  but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me  i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you  you know what i have done  i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening  a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	655.0120
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	389.0038
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world	817.3022
let us save ourselves  at these words she passed her arm under that of dartagnan and urged him forward eagerly	928.2664
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him	349.7200
whereon the balcony  not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed  oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur dartagnan is right  the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger	732.6344
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine oclock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priests breviary	1775.5396
but you sent for me my dear child	394.1648
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament  more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament  the queen shook her head despairingly	2368.6316
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint mran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300000 livres	891.1284

one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy  as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la rserve m morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dants should be the successor to the late captain leclere	1702.0490

however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy  so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box	1274.3448
now guess what the young one did  tell me  he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body	423.9231
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat	785.6456
as to aramis he never played	504.2783
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de trville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it  his threat completed the intimidation of the host	294.6263
i know what i am saying continued the marchioness i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage	540.6450
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened	1605.0648
such as were only beautiful gave their beauty whence without doubt comes the proverb the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place nor their battles afterward without the purse more or less furnished which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow	885.6427
because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape  ah	1127.9630
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill	477.9780
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m de villefort her devotion to the elder dants	585.0707
but i could find nothingabsolutely nothing	2264.8506
oh you do not understand me	266.7315
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	1412.7009
ask my beloved sister hayde who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you  you then love hayde asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate	1257.6031
dartagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre	1095.5804
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne	1035.1458
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods	762.7167
athos appeared	1867.9316
at last said aramis we are ready are we  yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the  because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	639.4741
that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery  thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	711.3126
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed	652.9005
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos	560.0864
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner	281.5392
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way	555.5323
you should have allowed me to sleep	516.4765
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall aramis seized his knife dartagnan arose	632.1744
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf	703.1489
besides it has perhaps been her majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly	1454.9646
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see after the worthy mercer later	681.9454
ah said beauchamp you doubt me	429.5878
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head	609.0934
milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down	2389.2498
my friend said she how came you here	410.7728
i was there too and i never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	680.4726
well asked dartagnan	452.0695
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	451.8304
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation	1185.4215
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl	1900.5574
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection	798.4703
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	724.4501
your pardon m morrel said dants approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service	977.6711
and yours  i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor  franz dpinay started with surprise	1304.7704
dartagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and dartagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince	653.0550
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme  20143m    and you will probably find your theme ill chosen  but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	867.3453
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	717.4061
what next	392.7322
but what are you looking for  i am looking for the person who let down the ladder	390.7866
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan	1113.8628
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage	1368.6897
you pretend to pardon me and you poison me  i cried dartagnan	508.1796
but wait	1474.3140
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes	851.7361
it is not very difficult to say  tell us then dartagnan  we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to france	919.4379
but go a little way from francego either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streetspeople erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago he will be a dead man in a month  then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia  ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything	1481.7783
she is ill	647.9803
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces itno madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison  madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features	1028.0726
as for porthos i believe him to be eternal like god although less patient	914.4116
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained	1353.1802
thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m de trville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and trville nextor even perhaps before himself	823.9869
ha ha cried lord de winter ha ha	378.8005
we hope so answered the curates	1423.2927
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded	1993.1349
submit this honour to somebody else and he sat down	1312.3691
with regard to dartagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet	648.8321
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne  the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold	619.3526
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society	1153.1927
grimaud speaks	871.1611
take something  mme	1553.3934
ah	27.5591
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the htel of m de la trmouille in whose service he had a relative dartagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with dartagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror	952.0670
m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night	758.6166
the blow was parried	507.3099
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him	733.6671
in all well organized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning	2210.3640
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london  and as to my other instructions asked the fair traveler	417.3778
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	466.2609
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edwards room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor	957.9182
really that demoiselle daubigne is very charming  so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished	1313.7955
for my part i should not hesitate a moment i should take the hundred pistoles	495.2005
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the kings presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time  but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night  doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him	756.8840
i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you  i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation  and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes i can easily comprehend that	419.6516
what an idea	1093.8438
planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of dartagnan and which dartagnan from that time made shift to do without	396.3919
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum	456.2569
you called me didnt you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table	585.8915
you are brave monsieur dartagnan continued his eminence you are prudent which is still better	711.6379
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second	404.4406
this evening sir he replied all will be ready     chapter xlvi	1118.3717
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	1373.6824
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	1707.5027
you see there are two wanting  eight days my lord  i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow  my lord they shall be yours  you are a jewel of a man mr oreilly but that is not all	903.2516
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not	582.1007
in that case replied the abb he should be a man blessed of god rich happy  caderousse smiled bitterly	857.7662
really villefort you surprise me	526.4569
this morning i awoke at six oclock	1273.0979
the king don carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace	1236.4203
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried dartagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other  why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english  spain is her country replied dartagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself	570.9033
do you know her  milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid	329.2280
ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever	662.9777
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses  my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady  the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and saidupon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner	429.7968
look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated roof  very well said the gentleman	798.2625
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion	1019.4282
what reason do you assign  my reason replied the young girl	830.0629
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	1564.7906
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere	1022.6503
at the sight of the stranger m morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair	497.6901
you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous	1719.9128
i am not mistaken  dartagnan cried rochefort	951.5632
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by dartagnan	933.5865
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle	415.9374
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar	618.6288
on your knees count  athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight	668.1602
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished	392.7671
the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand	732.7700
this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performinga make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill temper	660.3250
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dants	539.1389
listen said he	94.3696
there was no peculiar indication in any organan excitement of the nervous systemthat was it a case of cerebral congestionnothing more	2482.6597
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo	461.3818
we shall meet again master dartagnan continued the leader raising his voice	1088.8777
you know them likewise	1607.8571
is there anything new in the wind  nothing  i thought perhaps that the kings death  has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here  what have you come for then  to embark with you  ah	824.3631
oh cried porthos whats the matter now	969.6207
he strictly followed the instructions he had received	1150.6754
or he will forget us added dartagnan	686.6932
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man	1726.6625
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us  oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse mehe is inflexiblehe will never pardon me	433.5122
my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his willfor he was master	852.6976
this promise completed poor kittys consolation	1189.8846
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another	531.6885
when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say hes a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master	1379.4081
oh god prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead  oh god murmured the girl leave me my mother  your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning around	1853.9080
what said mousqueton	723.3507
you know her it seems said chteau renaud	898.4188
the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price	771.6768
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple	368.5379
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray	1992.2200
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way  perhaps replied dartagnan	622.7077
jealousy gnawed his heart and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber	692.3163
what	62.2766
the result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody knows	725.6100
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden	409.5902
they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and m de trvilles note in the other	487.6729
well what do you see from this window	346.8703
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield	2131.4829
maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot	1228.5826
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	681.2823
a police agent entered	1440.2926
then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison	1364.2758
we are ready  ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said did i not answer for them  but you sir said the queen to aramis	614.1695
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the barons house  there has been a misunderstanding  what with the baroness  no with the baron  has he perceived anything  ah that is a good joke  do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness	685.0984
dartagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished	1035.2035
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them  very well i understand  go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business  porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	308.0874
i am not forgotten	845.8643
the order is positive	148.9032
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried he	369.8036
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone	474.8179
we must play the farce to the end	729.8522
sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me unheard	433.2861
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains	964.5026
the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king	522.3688
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror	977.5490
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friends chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself againthat is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men	734.8063
i dont know him	656.8207
no listen to me i have the true idea  let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young musketeer	452.5916
oh how happy you make us	695.4731
one of us would suffice  really my dear monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me  i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence  and bernouindo i not take him with me  there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence  let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish  my lord there is time to draw back said dartagnan and your eminence is perfectly free  not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off  and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of dartagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling	775.0540
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay  your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	545.6840
why yourself to be sure	497.0339
three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds	426.4888
oh dont let that disturb you cried mme	996.5575
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned	437.6635
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime	909.8360
why buy what one can take  take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor	1488.3448
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy	511.2659
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited	635.5067
oh said i to him	82.2489
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	814.7228
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark	482.8496
well i was not hot headed then  well but what else could you play for	708.7185
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers	691.6309
is that all  yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	1181.5017
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days	950.4450
oh oh	1709.9634
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth	1167.0588
left alone she arose	1736.3888
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest  50093m    you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet feltyou are mistaken valentine dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger	1516.4208
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me	746.4978
we shall require it  yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do  this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	1205.4834
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them aramis had eight of them	649.2961
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly	1187.2770
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual	883.6971
be assured then of seeing me soon return   capital cried athos you are the king of poets my dear aramis	600.6891
dartagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times	1141.7050
lord winter you are not the king you are my uncle  at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged  think of my mother shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop	254.9968
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do	498.7675
you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness	988.8009
remember your oath	302.3691
conclusion	14.5921
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head	461.4207
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune	306.5385
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	664.9808
aramis went to cromwells desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis	1933.6790
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say furtherthe art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance  but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land	1784.8713
nothing replied maximilian	1252.2690
dants had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek	707.8118
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention	995.8597
monsieur dartagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live	491.0836
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible	642.4039
in brief how much remains  twenty five pistoles said dartagnan	1874.8483
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent	1124.3090
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son  may i ask how much he allows the young man  five thousand francs per month  sixty thousand francs per year	353.8984
you appear to think much of your horse	455.6765
if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank i do not like anyone to deny his origin  oh you are a thorough democrat said monte cristo smiling	471.2094
in a few minutes valentine re entered the garden alone	457.0560
it may be supposed that dants did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal	578.2368
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me  i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly	285.7851
still though not actually received at the htel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess	852.7208
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king	695.6180
say on  you will permit me to make one remark  certainly pray do so  then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress  indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction	582.5180
then i saw that they took me for the assassin	309.0748
eugnie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise darmilly her singing teacher	680.7943
let it come said athos	276.0190
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abblike all other abbs  and what was the end of the affair  we met in the place royaleegad	375.6943
it was cold and motionless	692.1958
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene	1368.6714
then when de winter rose to take leave  listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband	693.8533
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect	1000.0244
speak  you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness  who are you then	616.1512
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heartthree of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning	913.0025
you may madame said he with emphasis	597.6400
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos	1037.8580
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	553.4193
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world	336.2540
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity	1570.0226
what was there in it  a letter addressed to monsieur de trville captain of the musketeers  indeed  exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency  the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger	386.7181
but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now  merciful heavens  besides mother why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed	562.6983
well said he let us go to valentine i will give instructions to everyone and you m de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them  40294m    at the moment when davrigny was returning to valentines room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m de villefort	385.3295
madame we are yours body and soul  oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years i have felt the least approach to joy or hope	624.7736
did he send you  yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you i have come in fifteen hours  albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper	484.0800
grimaud moved as if to leave the room	382.6622
get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men  a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	402.4493
whoi cried milady i a protestant	896.7368
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood	2121.4607
you will get me out if they put me there said dartagnan	426.4409
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out	584.0461
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money	1221.0876
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction  an admirable subject cried the jesuit	977.8212
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo	457.9900
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed  at what	456.8665
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything	1003.3492
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compigne and all is over  madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold	584.6761
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silentin france she is paid only when she speaks	601.1501
still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong	783.5352
i could interpret one of your looks  then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown  instantly  but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service	944.9395
chapter xli	361.7552
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune  oh that depends upon circumstances	806.6029
the queen is likely to follow mazarins counsels and to have me tried  do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does  did she not love an englishman  my friend she is a woman  no no you are deceivedshe is a queen  dear friend i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria  adieu athos i am going to raise an army  for what purpose  to come back and besiege rueil  where shall we meet again  at the foot of the cardinals gallows  the two friends departedaramis to return to paris athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen	855.2928
a short time ago while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m dartagnan printedas were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the bastilleat amsterdam by pierre rouge	1679.5361
what are my commands said the queen	381.3761
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed  true said la ramee	1255.4929
who is in command here asked the cardinal	352.5589
58 he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents   sign it continued the count	776.5374
in five minutes it will be too late  mme	1063.7765
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	1261.9414
uncle and nephew	1511.7699
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	693.5275
i believe so replied aramis	657.1483
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor  but cried morrel this purse is not yours julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning	610.4731
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men	1114.1809
peppino was a handsome young man of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear	487.4434
yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows	764.6415
athos remained sitting	415.7889
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here  during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said  madame princeswho by nature are above other menreceive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes	966.6007
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way	374.3427
under orders from general cromwell	2475.4407
27 replied the count	175.4846
the gratitude of anne of austria	1097.1342
but i require three weeks preparation at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please  three weeks cried albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor  had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir  well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in  m	370.4038
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk	1307.2708
what does he want with me said monte cristo	443.3035
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five and twenty years of exile	1542.0303
what might be the consequences	713.7847
30221m    is it not so asked monte cristo	325.3016
i have distrusted god i could the more easily distrust you	1078.3750
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank	532.9035
dants from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	1816.0314
the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth	1117.5603
faithless court	876.5771
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow	560.3009
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	697.4445
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report	622.3414
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy  faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus	1149.6744
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos	483.1582
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones	1370.0211
but devil take him	973.3395
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress	755.3329
the guide carried away the torch	664.6226
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city	1177.7954
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed	518.2271
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village  armentires read porthos armentires	780.2806
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months	1396.9537
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden	614.6093
but speak i will listen  you recollect that sad night when you were half expiring on that bed in the red damask room while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery	615.0009
to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains walls hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream	2193.2476
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious  and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him	1027.3865
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated	1144.2386
irrevocably  you hear sir said dartagnan turning to mordaunt	489.9823
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband	1106.0487
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die  monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness	661.9583
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	655.7717
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in haste	873.4071
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal	1369.0239
sit down dear count and go on with your story  at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame	383.4427
dants turned and perceived that they had got out to sea	514.5893
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhne to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes	595.8855
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash	1899.4221
coquenard had seen everything	799.2729
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and re enter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra	168.6376
a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry	653.2789
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now  no father stammered villefort at least i hope not  and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care  oh rely on me said villefort	959.5095
now you are a man and are able to give me advice yet i repeat to you albert be prudent  why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust	416.4865
let us load the guns  the four musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready	872.4231
he feared then to see her too often	852.7476
you are a noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me	705.3754
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him	457.0370
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting	985.8965
all this showed dartagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this veil	511.0778
he has returned said he	273.7379
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide	1668.3237
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king  to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority  and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal  he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	562.8746
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice  sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns	479.1107
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said dartagnan and share the three hundred  we will share said porthos	568.4073
sir sir cried he turning to noirtier do what you canmake me understand in some way  yes replied noirtier	724.0579
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them	356.4400
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain dartagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouththey had been so impressed upon his mind	365.2196
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september	798.1064
isnt this fox a genius athos asked the gascon	981.3366
i always said that dartagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which dartagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence	338.6637
i cannot swim and dared not throw myself into the river	1714.3075
in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him	486.4046
i thought i had said porthos resuming his melancholy air but i have been taught my mistake  you have some cried the procurators wife in a transport that surprised even herself	601.6804
she opened the door	269.9240
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival	387.3502
i expected thee said the bandit to ritas father	1399.4686
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens  albert approached	1538.7095
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	973.1655
a glorious prize	833.3924
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game	2345.5605
revolt	22.0362
40194m    business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	623.5409
edmond said mercds i have but one word more to say to you  the count smiled bitterly	352.6944
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it  upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think  cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our timeit is precious	819.2117
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical	1149.7314
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simplea cabbage for instance	945.9732
whats the knot for thought dants	824.1705
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will that is to say beauty meekness and tearsand above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness	1655.1617
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair	407.4187
after you however said cromwell	658.4865
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence	1251.1321
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	2363.5320
ah yes said mousqueton	708.2952
ah	60.8447
it is easy to suppose that morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating eye	1222.0632
grimaud smiled	216.7453
he tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through	692.3024
dants drew back and gazed on the abb with a sensation almost amounting to terror	838.4304
never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the hearer	339.0279
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	353.1771
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot  let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper  dartagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athoss arm and went out without saying anything	359.1165
it is he exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos it is he	312.2918
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared	856.0590
why thats as long as the almighty took to make the world	546.3730
defend yourself  one minute said the young man	507.5437
eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak	1470.9988
well said the queen it has been refused  the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	515.3523
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune	1227.8318
there are men somewhere about but thats of no consequence to us said dartagnan let us ride onward  at about half past eight oclock they reached the first houses in noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village	977.4390
the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato	1424.5562
listen	55.3070
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself	857.6824
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain	1186.5367
chapter lxxvii	729.7397
this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	970.4473
major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence continued monte cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million  monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed	2269.7458

there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver	629.5942
i say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret  which you will guard i hope young man as your life  but which i must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty  is this secret your own  no monsieur it is her majestys  are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to me  no monsieur for on the contrary i am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery  why then are you about to betray it to me  because as i said without you i can do nothing and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it  keep your secret young man and tell me what you wish  i wish you to obtain for me from monsieur dessessart leave of absence for fifteen days  when  this very night  you leave paris  i am going on a mission  may you tell me whither  to london  has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there  the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my success  and you are going alone  i am going alone  in that case you will not get beyond bondy	520.2315
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey	1030.7227
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips	813.0203
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title  why said the banker	280.1168
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to miladys chamber	792.4897

by the torchlight dants saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes	2286.1672
come and roll me to bed	485.3578
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all  i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	559.3178
cannot i serve you as a waiting maid	660.1109
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply	840.3805
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet and if i am taken i will swallow it  well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said dartagnan	414.1552
are you coming morrel  directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no	498.5062
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose	722.3260
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three	971.4853
oh	35.9192
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there  revenge for instance observed franz	420.5613
ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable	1038.6323
tell them said morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed	533.7804
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says  he is quite right returned beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he does	689.0125
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dants  every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice  i am he what is your pleasure with me  edmond dants replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law  me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray  i cannot inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination  m morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless	766.5516
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean debray chteau renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit	1477.3188
has your excellency anything to ask me said vampa with a smile	547.0928
no sooner said than done	1252.0314
the concert must be a delightful one  they suit each other remarkably well said danglars	1746.2545
i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure	835.3664
all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september	954.4316
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	745.2686
he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living	753.8516
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man	430.0779
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris	929.5620
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas	1221.8040
i have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas	594.7094
four hours later he was in neufchtel	1394.8604
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	1058.0288
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	1340.3685
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this	808.0905
yes sir he said in a softened tone	491.4396
to wait replied athos	933.0681
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety	795.7132
sir you know well i would risk my life for you  thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet	1566.7947
she who mistaking you for the cardinals guards has just fled away  your companion cried dartagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress	1245.1394
chapter xiii	119.1188
dartagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments	585.2761
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk	541.3595
i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	1231.4161
come my friend said he courage then he turned to the officer	278.1922
conversational	81.6046
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abb dherblay of whom you have often heard me speak  i remember him monsieur  come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	417.9789
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything	652.3929
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone	576.9556
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive	922.6461
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	920.8568
stop said albert here he comes	632.5942
as soon as possible  i am at your command sir shall we return together  if not unpleasant to you  on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure  thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy	613.9186
he he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung	752.9377
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris  eugnie covered her face with her hands	773.6006
do not let us do things in a hurry	552.1085
at eight oclock all were in their places and m de morcerf entered at the last stroke	811.8275
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud  my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion	982.0641
de saint mran madame de saint mran m noirtier  how	1960.9651
dead  no dying  saddled  yes saddled and bridled  then we are upon the fugitives  courage we have them  but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us  nonsense cried dartagnan theyll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit theyll be afraid and will disperse  certainly remarked porthos	1165.7062
dartagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head	639.0355
well those studs continued mme	516.2572
dartagnan was perplexed	990.4481
dants was on his bed	247.0625
ho	17.6149
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars	475.3734
what are you doing asked milady with surprise	673.8741
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinals death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand	960.1301
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascusyou remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde	1226.3743
since the death of madame de saint mran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house	537.7168
i wish you to do so said he	169.5220
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette rue tiquetonne and there await me  thats agreed said porthos	688.2447
but as regards the letter of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself	552.6622
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to alis finger	1028.4232
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy	1123.8035
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger  that is well understood  and in that case how shall i know where you are  you do not want your lackey  is he a sure man  to the proof  give him to me	430.6469
i may have been mistaken  at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew	629.9912
yes grandpapa said valentine it is so	493.8576
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel  at the hotel of said porthos by my faithnor do i remember it either  it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain  alas	328.2973
the next morning king charles i was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	896.9929
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman	744.8079
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort	638.7936
sire resumed trville as i told you monsieur dartagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen	349.6335
teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics	765.1334
the counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man	1208.5016
two hours passed thus madame de saint mran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	747.3740
oh sirsaid she clasping her hands	743.5105
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the htel de londres	2209.2300
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a magdalen by correggiowas raised and turned towards him	546.4913
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possiblethat the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have 50000 remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept	1159.7593
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet	606.0745
the pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters name	1226.2772
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside	2062.5554
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket	1031.6659
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later	934.9207
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way	999.4266
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred	731.6523
i want air that is all  will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase	675.7515
oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death  morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder	982.2500
chapter xxv	1298.6029
heyday cried dartagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken	704.9622
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone	1000.4513
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather  no no no replied the eye of the paralytic	406.5334
my poor eugnie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts  i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady	820.1080
if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color if on the contrary the lemonade be drugged with poison the syrup will become green	1515.7823
monsieur de beaufort or another	1118.3956
come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dants to follow captain lecleres instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble  0027m    how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dants for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	379.2805
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family	681.5689
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence	871.0531
dartagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and dartagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it  as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old masters company	1028.8901
answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer  i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me  it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monks bones	627.6829
well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladys agitation revealed tell me what is the matter  oh lucien can i confide in you  of course you know you can do so	713.6210
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos	663.2303
who has displeased you	891.9897
your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want  monsieur dartagnan  i will answer for everything  nothing is so catching as confidence	592.4149
perceiving m de trville at a distance  come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you	616.9303
ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon	1341.7510
very brave said monte cristo i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head  and i know he has fought two duels said morrel	495.7877
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	238.7815
both got into alberts coup and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance	527.1721
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	1172.4241
the contract shall not be signed cried morrel	1542.2817
he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset	1429.9097
it was then that the door of edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared	374.5677
neither had his eyes bandaged	930.0306
the poor girl under the caresses of dartagnan lifted her head	1059.5924
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty	539.1777
too long a waittoo long  but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo  oh i shall not cried franz	591.8129
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you  madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage	886.9532
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another	542.4991
really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france	1587.0726
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief	797.6818
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honor itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris	1245.0194
this is the second time that monsieur dartagnan has been in england	317.3124
monte cristo drew out his watch	907.0875
last year i had four apricotsthey stole one i had one nectarine only onewell sir they ate half of it on the wall a splendid nectarinei never ate a better  you ate it  that is to say the half that was leftyou understand it was exquisite sir	1837.0842
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power	411.7331
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens	1849.3662
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal	367.8546
i think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not	594.5453
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	625.5725
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair	454.8445
is this carriage for me said dants	343.1690
the kings authority will put all this to rights  was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence  no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves  is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion  yes said the queen it is requested  the coadjutor bowed	813.7755
he did not dare to write for fear of not being ableto such experienced eyes as those of miladyto disguise his writing sufficiently	1522.3850
a gascon a match for cupid   the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by dartagnan at last arrived	827.8828
captivity the fifth day  chapter lvii	395.5943
another might threaten to seek m franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly	746.2637
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us	483.2575
nothing  my faith	924.3221
i do not know replied dants	505.0301
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majestys wishes will be complied with  do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will commence  the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room	429.4932
you cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other  if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement	664.9133
one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door	638.2312
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine  i have already told you that we do not sell at retail  well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive  they are all the same price  and what is that  twenty five thousand francs a bottle  tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealingtell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal  it is possible such may be the masters intention  the masterwho is he  the person to whom you were conducted yesterday  where is he  here  let me see him  certainly  and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars	585.5413
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	2230.1553
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought dartagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence  there reigned a perfect stillness in the house	706.7022
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest	422.7031
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor  and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	670.8029
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majestys special guard	1085.6317
my shoulder quite burns  if you would permit me said dartagnan with timidity	1592.5811
i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor  because i was shown up the private stairs  how so  i know not it must have been a mistake  mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing	307.2652
dartagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself	866.9359
and then continued mme	1240.2614
it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris  thats unfortunate  oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris  but what shall i wear  what you find in your trunks  in my trunks	1674.0669
in the first horseman she recognized dartagnan	838.3465
they entered for the door was not lockedthere is much confidence among villagers	1282.2157
now sir i am listeninggo on  i will come at once to the point	470.1104
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	722.8839
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	1122.5356
now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and cannot be legally exercised  the notary then prepared to retire	578.0457
ah	27.4240
his costume of guardsman in the company of m dessessart ought to be his passport	781.3004
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so	361.1317
the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king with an air of condolence very displeasing to me that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers those daredevilshe dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to methose braggarts added he glancing at me with his tiger cats eye had made a riot in the rue frou in a cabaret and that a party of his guards i thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters	801.5339
who  him  himm	259.9406
great god she is losing her senses  while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt	696.8381
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back	1040.2804
beware said i for my liberty is your dishonor  explain yourself my pretty sibyl  yes for as soon as i leave this place i will tell everything	823.2447
leave me alone said aramis impatiently	830.9562
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you  heyday cried dartagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell whos an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman	691.8025
no no answered dants dont imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner	827.4167
he turned round it was danglars	600.9919
the black horses of the musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incognito	822.8691
alas  the queen  i was going to say theres no longer a queen	381.1742
go said he in a subdued voice and find rochefort	439.5194
we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears	845.0624
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	805.7523
i am mad for her  kitty breathed a second sigh	1565.0250
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled  philosophy m bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life  oh excellency  no no but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy  my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive	698.3134
what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall	1541.6646
dartagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity	835.8096
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	658.1967
but pardon me are you free	650.5164
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased	738.1637
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarins than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right	949.4783
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains	226.5180
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rentas i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy  how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux replied dartagnan trust me i am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct and if as i told you i can be of any service to you  i believe you monsieur i believe you and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you  finish then what you were about to say  the citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to dartagnan	420.0607
mine also are from him  indeed sir i recognize you you are captain mordaunt  mordaunt was startled	852.5460
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad	966.8193
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god	748.5052
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	803.6042
then taking a passport from his drawer he saidgood it is available for two months longer     chapter 105 the cemetery of pre lachaise  m de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth	1567.5864
through the grating however dants saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay	1091.8027
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life	722.6492
yes albert from whatever source the blow may have proceededit may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence  albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamps arm  my friend said he my life is ended	988.7273
that is doubtless our boat said athos	726.5775

they had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded	773.4812
pray relate it to me  caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time  well my good friend returned the abb in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	673.4951
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won	1055.2118
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired	775.1489
cries of down with mazarin death to the cardinal resounded on all sides	544.1035
chapter xlii	259.7061
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron	522.4230
csar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard	330.3472
are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name  undoubtedly  really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people	732.4738
i will therefore proceed	2268.8542
they had only halberds before now they have muskets	1232.7555
the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordered with tombs	1388.9963
dartagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	565.4936
shall you keep it or send it back  i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it	490.4604
felton said milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to you	632.3903
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	702.9565
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes	1008.5989
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips	1231.5043
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	1177.0751
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases  ah if i were in your place said albert	925.5963
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	466.3650
i gave her good advice by which she did not profit	865.6991
returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet	999.8341
disguised as a coachman exclaimed mazarin	753.2030
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness	906.9159
do you aramis order the servants	383.1671
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please	496.8690
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath	754.1644
you were saying madame  i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor  impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others	329.8300
we have no time to lose i will question and do you answer me noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer	323.4736
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey	640.5823
but all my fortune is in england	432.7885
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular	1465.2178
they explained what had occurred that evening	1101.0634
i am called louis the just monsieur de trville and by and by by and by we will see  ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty  wait then monsieur wait said the king i will not detain you long  in fact fortune changed and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagneif we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance	345.5325
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine	447.2132
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king  the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane	1214.5333
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle darmillys fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantios malediction on desdemona	1284.2170
he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet	488.8969
question then my lord  where did the army cross the lys  between saint venant and aire  by whom is it commanded  by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke  of how many does it consist  eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon  and its aim is  lens  you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers	1534.3347
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	1106.4961
at the end of three months he had learned to read	395.4423
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant  what	588.6788
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner	943.4007
so much the better duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the door	432.9586
godo you hear said villefort while davrigny advanced to lead morrel out	887.5188
i have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of dartagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon  but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him  no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	1611.9087
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming	557.2135
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	1792.3407
what does he mean asked a gendarme	1061.4954
pardieu said villefort he is a noble fellow	368.4815
immediately m de trville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	592.7269
now that i have the word of athos i can set out  dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	384.7498
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn	1682.6680
well what shall you do with this money count	330.7390
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me  i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf	780.8058
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon	704.6166
i believe these fellows have managed their business	1568.2006
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea	936.6471
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	557.8816
i shall pass all my life thought dartagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot  whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct	643.1045
do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out  you know of whom i speak count do you not  perfectly well my good friend and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons	538.5464
he was nineteen when he entered the chteau dif he was thirty three when he escaped	799.7205
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	898.1421
the king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fte	487.3058
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	410.3632
we have a precious fellow here  monsieur grimaud said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the reach of my fist  hush	541.9955
if you would but accept my offers	812.5831
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move	678.1553
pardieu said he here is a strange thing	352.7863
mme	30.2277
since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully	683.3219
dants was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper	716.1620
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket  the casket would encumber you	868.0909
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert	1021.3563
what a scandal	1988.3176
the famous secretaire is in the dressing room  is there a window in the dressing room  twoone here and one there andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom	893.5909
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded  he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it	443.0300
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by lopold robert or schnetz	585.5762
monsieur bonacieux  chapter xiv	1490.8551
there is the little door opening into the garden	430.3643
where are your musketeers	563.0980
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside	1231.2101
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for  the voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the partition	596.0199
it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine	254.7704
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause  it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting  monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law	629.7560
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war  come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate  before a siege  yes the conditions will be better than afterward  ah my lord	628.8822
oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant i shall be dressed  athos then called olivain	1204.9547
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse	1249.6140
cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal dukeall things which appeared to dartagnan monstrous impossibilities	1439.5718
sure of what  that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself  what lord ruthven do you mean  why our lord ruthventhe vampire of the salle argentina  is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris  to be surewhy not  and you visit himmeet him at your own house and elsewhere  i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m de chteau renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance  but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize  was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa  what of that  why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner  oh yes  and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner  to be sure i remember it all now  he called himself vampa	600.0784
30349m    m	727.4156
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned dartagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	628.5555
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	1014.7675
you have guessed it answered aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were fighting	647.7124
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes	490.1286
andrea extended his hand bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money	994.2332
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you  i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo	187.1458
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god last of all i speak to you	283.9849
my very self dear friend  me also repeated porthos	1311.4896
you shall die  and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon dartagnan	858.1757
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it  at what hour shall we come asked the young man	1195.5913
felton let me die  well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner	550.3582
franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello	287.5697
a murder	1041.7810
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies  meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another	2482.6077
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain  i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood	482.0628
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort	438.9922
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third	759.9714
yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein	676.6904
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham  anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said	2124.1492
valentine	24.2984
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends	1275.5996
you perceive then that he is not happy said the count	279.6704
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays  holidays  yes  when  when we have a fog  ah to be sure  those are indeed holidays to me i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long  how long have you been here  ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen  you are  fifty five years old  how long must you have served to claim the pension  oh sir twenty five years  and how much is the pension  a hundred crowns  poor humanity murmured monte cristo	544.7853
my son i bless thee  the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans bed	823.7972
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took	594.5337
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated	1240.9250
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy	918.8488
but there are no more said she	328.6872
milady was all attention	581.4332
by degrees milady became more communicative	580.3632
this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellow creature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption  ah said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano  your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably	807.5820
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you	1459.3523
from la rochelle and you  from england  buckingham  dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him	996.9292
it is my wish that she should marry m franz dpinayand she shall marry him  valentine sank weeping into a chair	1338.9343
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor	1106.4554
without divulging his secret dants could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	2250.9961
27  yes no	537.0016
keep watch from seven to nine	1133.1599
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry  true said andrea	915.7883
one said the grave diggers two	1699.3071
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in  they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at dartagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look	1065.4727
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance	493.5256
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	1570.9316
here it is i see  at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raouls horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel	1902.7771
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies	1285.1116
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative	675.5162
grimaud seemed to him an antinous	966.7616
finally he slept	1095.3345
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	783.5640
you have my promise he said after a minutes pause extending his hand to monte cristo	617.4954
ah fie dartagnan replied	383.7276
gentlemen thus dartagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him	908.4141
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercds but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall find  i have found already  what  i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself  pooh	586.8455
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression	1065.3380
all looked around athos himself stared	2067.5134
i think i hear a noise she said leave me  good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with gratitude	535.3991
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light	402.2770
see i have sold my watch for 100 francs and the guard and seals for 300 how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch	955.4862
but ibut i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross  leap coward cried raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir said he courage	247.0866
yes said athos by his own nephew  come he was the first of us to go peace be to him	282.3341
what would you have me say  give all the information in your power  tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little  have you served under the usurper  i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell  it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation	424.8438
the abbess introduced them to each other	1440.2329
he was a foreigner  an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe  let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone  caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller	883.4001
thanks guitant i shall benefit by your advice this very evening  here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure	1283.7367
he then looked at the objects near him	517.9073
i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome  i have still twenty pistoles sir  well take them that makes seventy  and if you wish for more said porthos putting his hand to his pocket  thank you sir replied raoul blushing thank you a thousand times  at this moment olivain appeared	521.6056
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis	310.8148
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence	689.9836
well for my part said athos i found aramiss spanish wine so good that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys	658.5464
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy	453.8693
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip	693.0112
what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard	488.7461
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him	508.4324
will there be any mass asked one of the attendants	548.5590
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort	804.4274
undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow  what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	669.8287
yesyes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy  and why  because mercds is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens  really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness	477.3177
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste  certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy  de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up  and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments	728.0878
the general who had almost fainted revived	1555.0900
chapter 104 danglars signature  the next morning dawned dull and cloudy	447.3378
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling	404.8201
he delayed presenting himself at morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him	928.6263
what is that news asked dartagnan	434.6537
30185m    madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority	736.9370
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	1031.1659
let her alone said he	228.9623
but his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it  so much the better said athos	1381.0481
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught  yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel	1844.8777
this young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition  what occupies him in england  he is one of cromwells most enthusiastic disciples  but what attached him to the cause	1596.8431
oh unfortunate creature	174.1138
i do not  hem said dartagnan there is some truth in what you say  ah	532.4430
you think then said he that i am taken to the chteau dif to be imprisoned there  it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard  without any inquiry without any formality  all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made  and so in spite of m de villeforts promises  i do not know what m de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the chteau dif	443.4472
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy	1224.3801
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock	576.6788
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him	1178.8102
yes your majesty cried the duke	418.8140
as you see my health is but indifferent	692.8113
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs	1908.5317
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness	382.5663
happily dartagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties	1234.1813
but this vessel which like the pharaon came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon	809.2161
this is all very strange said m de trville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud  yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence but why should i have done otherwise	1035.5609
i can do much for you my friend replied the count	277.7483
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 1000 francs for a mouthful of bread	1177.3193
i did not seek one i did not ask for one	414.9113
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives  the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him  pardon me said he but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw  come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it  by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it  be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal	393.9147
what ails you my dearest father	2005.5239

you are deceived monsieur i know her very well  ah said mme	628.1006

the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable  and do you not remember the frenchmans name said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator	1135.9086
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you  sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report  as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist	594.0196
i thank you for having recognized me sir debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor	1264.5134
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future	441.6659
m de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself  but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked villefort after a moments reflection what interest can this m de monte cristo or m zacconeson of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first timewhat interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this	475.3553

a tailor said the host and for what  to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert	996.5091

charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	655.7895
i was speaking of your fathers past history	1772.3701
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall	658.1556
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage	1400.0359
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said come despatch the dying  shall you go then albert asked franz	605.9052
pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer	1160.6970
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination	709.4238
if you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the other	312.0746
do not exaggerate your duty	585.7791
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini	997.0761

are you an angel and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror	1117.8854
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view	1303.9656
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness  happy father happy son said the count	756.3590
that miladys son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already  the devil he is said porthos	425.1371
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	910.9821
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince  my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty  the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old	1134.3325
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg	681.1874

is the countess up yet  if you wish i will inquire  yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three oclock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her  the valet left the room	723.4874
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	1825.0936
bonacieux dartagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair	1183.9149
m noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerm	894.2550
ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they havent left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they havent left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders  no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have askedonly i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie  very well sir said the host ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain  do as you like said raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place	697.6504
he wished once again to press the counts hand but his own was immovable	816.7077
he must wait	1658.0251
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand	846.8707
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear dartagnan  what	487.6140
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly  however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you  yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	2001.3234
charles stuart you are our prisoner  and both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned	689.9629
that time you had nothing to say to me i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second	262.7983
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family	385.4228
as to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary	706.9115
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most intimate of his friends	635.0107
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital	883.0754
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dants who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head	566.6456
but she had her son	424.5360
what is his name said he	156.1382
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear	810.9523
i shall return very safely to the louvre all alone  as you please madame bonacieux said the ex mercer	924.6995
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready	453.7613
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him	670.4590
dartagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale	1029.7216
a sob was the only sound he heard	679.2673
it is you who stabbed selim	1733.4370
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugnie and the arrest of benedettovillefort having retired as well as noirtier and davrignyher thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard	232.5430

athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings	727.3962
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag	1050.5253
dartagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them	856.3151
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when dartagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing  dartagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness	698.1628
did you not tell me it was a family jewel  yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told me	581.8723
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word	586.3300
dartagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed	503.7503
i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke and even then when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces	982.9917

albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	1207.8690
i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack  be of good cheer replied dants your strength will return and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands	1279.8433
this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit  did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked beauchamp	775.8186
grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything	284.5455
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him	2236.2932
the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans bless with holy water sprinklers which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers	338.1358
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto dartagnans	419.2318
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow	349.4395
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint mrans	818.5659
oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness  heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself	956.9416
it is true i fought with tolerable success  i dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others  dartagnan pretended astonishment	1474.9073
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in	505.8193
now then to breakfast said beauchamp for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert  morrel muttered albertmorrelwho is he  but before he had finished m de chteau renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all overthat is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemarttook alberts hand	594.0978
it was five oclock in the afternoon i ascended into the red room and waited for night	590.3932

three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to svres	555.8386
as he passed the htel des gardes he took a glance into the stables	842.5665
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms  the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker	379.2131
havent you some one who will relieve me of my horse  groslow whistled and a sailor appeared	675.2267
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos  all gascon as he was dartagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	417.0275

yes yes and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured i will return the favor hereafter  villefort shook his head	351.6271
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	1462.2263
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear	966.0035

through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park	1624.4458
i say that he has hastily accused your majestys musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources  the accusation comes from monsieur de la trmouille from the duke himself	620.9402

athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	671.2710

when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door	910.9065
the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill  in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help  what is the matter with your highness asked la ramee	442.3474
the first he comes to	386.2905
put back that weapon dartagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	669.7830
why the devil	281.7879
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	869.2321

the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers	918.2150
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to trville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand	512.4448
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence	934.5668
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases  madame said dartagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him  what	626.6784
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself	557.2842
as this was the height of dartagnans worldly ambitionapart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme	1063.8983
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold  do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	646.1290
no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty	973.5874
my son exclaimed athos pressing him in his arms	741.5522
do you permit me to return  yes to morrow  the cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips	380.8802
do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier	752.9868
at eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that dartagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow	466.5585
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	142.4366
you will kill yourself cried planchet	1476.8809
after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet	1147.2960

two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would	836.1404

you are almost a boy  i see that you require someone to answer for me  i admit that would reassure me greatly  do you know athos  no  porthos  no  aramis  no	585.8289
now madame danglars feared eugnies sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle darmilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debrayan expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugnie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers	2101.0645
so my dear mother i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants  you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger	541.5733

another motive had influenced alberts selection of his seatwho knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival	740.1198
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse  but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof  ah no madame that could not be	514.6263

my young man said dartagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed	777.7940
i am weeping with joy  he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard	836.2699
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarins arrest wouldnt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage  say at once you disapprove of my proposal  i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france  i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	1478.6162

on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock	499.8520
dants employed it in manuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities	1817.5083
noirtier fixed his eyes on her	454.0050
the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square	1831.2743

daguillon his mistress and mme	464.8541
you have asked for me said the musketeer	245.2104
this was evidently an ambuscade	1742.5920
he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit	2458.0432
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april 1625 the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller	1168.6102
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady	449.4644
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir	744.5377
chapter lvii	1550.5620
dartagnan went straight to the sergeant	775.3152
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive	580.0691
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so  yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young mans excitement yes i would do so  you exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproachyou who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms	323.2599
in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count  you have doubtless heard the adventures of m zaccones youth  the fathers  no the sons  i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade  was he in the wars  i think he entered the service  in what branch  in the navy  are you not his confessor  no sir i believe he is a lutheran  a lutheran  i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france  doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him	1432.2462
but methinks i need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass	648.1605
ah	21.4361
come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army	577.3640
30233m    good said caderousse	606.5423
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner	721.1191
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant	310.6581
yes said athos magnificent	673.7170
i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals	1618.4529
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	665.5937
although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them	686.2935
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever	1399.3118
at last we are off exclaimed porthos	847.2896
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you cannot grudge it to me  debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie	728.7144
ah said dartagnan	176.8639
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	1449.5209
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	1705.4187
50273m    friend he cried i feel that i am dying thanks  he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him	630.9129
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch  in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence	585.5237
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse	1313.7848
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day	510.7099
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham	454.9673
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared  my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	1080.5317
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendshipi was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you  but monsieur porthos murmured the procurators wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong	1374.0498
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	1835.2220
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know	865.9035
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon	621.8914
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts	588.3644
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	499.5465
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed	608.7789
oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of davrigny	2169.7874
and now said the youths we have done all we can for you and as we are in haste to rejoin the princes army we must continue our journey	326.0811
when they reached the street aramis said  well athos what do you think  of whom  pardieu	484.1958
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see  yes i see  they are about to send into our court which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him  there they are coming out  if only they close the guardhouse door	623.2187
i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other  count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures  the stone seems very brilliant answered the count	445.8050
look at m andrea cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at murillos madonna now he is turning  this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from monte cristo silenced him	1124.3668
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz  ah indeed  so franz must wait	1063.8116
it was completely deserted	173.2288
i live there during my leave of absence continued maximilian and i shall be together with my brother in law emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us  one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply	655.6898
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty	506.4539
what fault do you find with the fellow  he is a glutton  oh sir cried olivain reappearing at this accusation	920.5485
good day monsieur dartagnan said planchet proudly	1335.6943
well	16.5778
well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	624.1438
these horses are equipped for the field	1139.9136
no madame if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it  really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne  are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied athos	905.1440
30297m    at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercds one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	754.5443
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dants he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	1063.4869
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies	287.4978
on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view	768.2825
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	837.6268
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains	1712.5492
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them  and i too said porthos	385.5201
i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian or too arabian	1282.2701
the lights again	355.4839
speak  the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before	488.7344
in the meantime dartagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached st cloud but instead of following the main street he turned behind the chteau reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named	1047.4885
she is there said he	149.0173
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter  strange	1384.8702
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence  i thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	540.1906
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man	638.7969
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping  milady reseated herself foaming	1599.9398
the procureur then told his wife to come up	721.6361
the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law  i know it sir replied monte cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	903.2335
precisely so replied gaetano	1525.6617
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him	880.4169
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes	869.7545
leave them said monte cristo	492.6677
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends  dear dartagnan	274.2845
yes my lord  and how much will that cost me monsieur dartagnan  zounds my lord i dont know yet	678.9348
oh heavens exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myselfthat young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf  yes said monte cristo i recognized him  how soyou were looking the other way  50209m    the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street	1455.4481
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies dartagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocationwhence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard	1432.0087
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	634.9517
moderato he cried as they descended	498.1685
he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister	651.1445
two months said he	420.2019
here he is  a man of about forty five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him	976.7648
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon	691.4440
but is he really a prince  i will not answer for it said monte cristo	321.7491
the jailer advanced dants appeared not to perceive him	1045.4093
oliver cromwell	632.3161
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were	1132.2537
as they stopped at the door of the cardinals study dartagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder	531.4613
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint mrans morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear	603.4037
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves  danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm	580.0984
he is a cardinal likewise	494.0571
i will not sign this order	496.8327
well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness	729.9570
and her son  florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same  come this way monte cristo took bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward	756.2512
chapter vii	1387.5281
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth 32000 francs to madame danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villeforts life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club	1743.9546

from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter	936.9951
i alone can save you and i will  valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her handsfor she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courageand began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress	762.4694
take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord	1044.6647
am i to be captured he cried no not if i can use more activity than my enemies	631.7107
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him	1074.3967
queen elizabeth and catherine ii	238.6410
he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged	1105.6041
they are yours take them  mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at dartagnan with open mouthed astonishment	1883.2726
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time	930.3491
from the time dartagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times dartagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	561.6306
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage	1145.9099

rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplicesone is mad the other dead	601.6015
this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss	654.5005

well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal  and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saint mran with an air of deep interest	1368.2883
whats the matter asked aramis	457.5835
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent	506.0578
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii	753.7650
franz gave him alberts letter	1786.7412
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m danglars disappearance	1657.2102
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning  all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling	885.0419
it neither increased nor decreased my income  albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject	1568.0952
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way  thats true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man	770.5873
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other	851.3817
his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy	966.1096
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh	529.9453
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here  an enemy cried mercds with an angry look at her cousin	342.2808

chapter 55 major cavalcanti  both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining alberts invitation	1210.7372
yes a base coward murmured dartagnan but sheshe was very beautiful  what she demanded the host	1417.6310
he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	1784.4467
dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend	1009.0983
the appointed hour was about to strike	1012.0787
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language	824.2628
felton entered miladys apartment	170.5884
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present  go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done  and you aramis are you of that opinion  entirely so my dear dartagnan  very good said dartagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe  the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous  dartagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	517.2401
dartagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing	352.0099
you can sign it  yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	718.5061

on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	1357.2777
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand	1526.8727

and have you any recollection of your country  when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again	439.0124
dants took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body	1540.5618

the court of his htel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six oclock in the morning in summer and eight oclock in winter	1238.9214
he grew pale and red alternately and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost	678.4490
you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question	749.7051
m de villefort followed them	760.5652
dartagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber	862.1942
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led dartagnan into it	401.7293
go go directly  dartagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady	865.8386
my god	1062.5183
dartagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other	560.1089
dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviiis throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire	520.5966
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket  you see then said dartagnan that i must have that letter	270.3173
no the sacrifice returned chteau renaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger  not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps  i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us  the history to which m morrel alludes continued chteau renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories	1195.4614
you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine villefort and davrigny exchanged looks	908.3322
your captivity shall be mild be assured and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance i cause you  dartagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus open handed sported with men and millions	1468.3309
but our troop horses said aramis	1354.1044
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door	668.3860
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot  the prisoner was led away	568.5431
theres a providence that watches over the deserving	1346.3923
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1f3	680.6092
de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse	634.6309
what is the matter my lord said athos and what puts you out of breath thus  nothing replied de winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round	482.4220
light me i am going to the queen  bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way	468.9846
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven	416.4260
now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable  to no one by heaven	930.4529
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byrons heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society  you say  i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag	480.9777
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime	647.4099
that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains	716.7735
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp	983.4919
in this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound	504.6406
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton	1853.0542
teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent	1302.5331
mouston appeared with a most piteous face	1397.8407
when i am convinced that the statement is false  what  the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly  but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamps last remark	505.5201
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	1697.6575
1e4	28.8417
what is his name  you know him  indeed  yes  it is surely not one of my friends replied dartagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant	420.3740
i will descend with my eyes shut  have you confidence in me said felton	527.1812
bonacieux took place	1163.8550
take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more  gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them  do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father	859.9999
paris is not paved with cambric  monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said dartagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions	937.3959
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph	286.1290
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite	1339.0576
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised	594.6990
m de saint mran had been unwell for some days still the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave	1278.3002
you are in a hurry said the musketeer as pale as a sheet	440.6675
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting	726.8966
have you not happy rogue that you arehave you not your duchess who cannot fail to come to your aid  well you see my dear dartagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world	955.1495
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy	1765.3879
the queen gave them to me the queen requires them again	577.7686
really m de blacas i must change your armorial bearings i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this devicetenax  0133m    sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience	1107.0921
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs	1781.2747
i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter  0091m    that is true answered the marquis	694.0245
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation  hush said athos speaking in a low voice	235.3593
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling	441.8892
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel chteau renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m de villeforts carriage	1059.0201
this manuvre was incomprehensible to dants	1929.9464
morrel said chteau renaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal  morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	494.1553
at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse	307.6027
i forgive you	1265.5063
yes and now i shall be more calm  you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling	514.1166
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph	730.7434
the queen	1284.0458
but mazarin is a low born rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an archer	972.2245
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound	1235.2386
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced	1244.2272
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto	700.0343
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by hayde during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected	1000.9943
is he living  patience monseigneur we are coming to it	873.4404
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fte should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it	554.9363
you are looking for my daughter said the baroness smiling	682.6693
on	43.2553
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos	404.0892
your very devoted husband  baron danglars  the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice	946.9847
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed	545.4577
see	27.8454
at the end of a year dants was a new man	294.3426
athos did not even turn his head	574.4484
explain yourself  grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole	577.2703
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	297.3971
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor	963.3544
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh	1879.2842
the beggar of st eustache	113.0585
we may well pity the poor fellows said the abb	636.3116
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle  dartagnan and porthos obeyed	405.4348
ah my poor friend	644.7733
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one	513.8768
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck	924.1608
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived	729.3725
1e5	86.9392
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	422.5314
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing	2097.2458
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	584.8769
m  the epistle is laconic said dartagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript  and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter	573.6248
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme	1429.1578
i am incredulous  the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal	1434.0619
he had good cause to do so the pain i gave him must have been atrocious	532.7447
one day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from england the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by cahusac and la houdinire strolled along the beach	1048.5060
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain	501.3468
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone  tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	782.1921
monsieur de comminges he said	371.2794
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortunesir i cannot understand your generosity  oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others  then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something  50227m    what have you to offer to me my friend	1034.7628
their masters are dead	2038.6455
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal	876.4189
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise	1070.4673
then listen said he	379.8395
besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair	368.9546
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	1266.6467
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them	1054.2699
im surprised you have never so much as asked after him	525.9681
you are not angry with me  not the least in the world  till then then  till then  bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick pace	491.4966
and i was ready to strangle you cried the duke	308.2909
stop	35.8683
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities  no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found  well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clment or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france  yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination  were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clment ever known  no for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were	1917.6221
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting	1188.6388
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant  oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name  i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation  and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you  yes  you do wrong  which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you  you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome  nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain  because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	892.1238
dartagnan went last still shaking his head	1154.4318
the hapless dants was doomed	608.4833
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	582.6978
he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited  you know not the subject of their conversation  he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london  was this woman english  he called her milady  it is he it must be he murmured trville	697.2921
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house	398.3990
what are you going to tell me  are we quite alone my friend  yes quite but why all these precautions  because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	588.9733
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room	427.6325
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively	908.5029
chapter 75 a signed statement  noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair	866.2498
do you perchance think i set any great store by life  there is something horribly mysterious under all this athos this woman is one of the cardinals spies i am sure of that  in that case take care	2029.6084
adieu perhaps farewell  at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw	509.8422
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions	766.2939
one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance	656.8911
and my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen i expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him  gave him cried dartagnan	474.2536
he entertains a very high opinion of m and madame de villefort  which they deserve do they not  i believe they do	721.7026
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	407.5326
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing  the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils	704.6940
oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with provisions  this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety	1491.0134
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone	388.7522
so now you are both forewarned  the young men bowed and quitted the box	725.9097
everything is paid replied the host and liberally	841.0123
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated	338.7827
return to greenwich and bring them here	873.7816
a cup of chocolate  i did not ask for it	650.4761
i come from the cardinal said the officer	232.6350
two of the men from jacopos boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles	723.7700
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility  the day after this important information had been given to the kings attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue frou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abb busoni were within	600.3795
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening	958.8348
in this case replied caderousse lets have some more wine	1349.0214
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner  but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dants and i hope he fully understood it  yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones patrons  i hope to be captain without that said dants	523.7585
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law  as you please sir said franz	500.5208
as to dartagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate	1014.8376
you	44.4031
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born child	2481.6135
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	1122.5994
have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdicta trial sir i ask only for a trial that surely cannot be denied to one who is accused  we shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor on my word the poor devil touches me	784.7571
theres a carriage coming over yonder  then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name  thats right	2112.5703
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer  come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	447.8997
the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty	556.2904
oh no	442.5963
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you	665.1378
dont lose a word of what im going to say to you porthos	400.1709
dartagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed	2227.2891
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity	1823.4764
none at all	229.0167
no	84.3921
but we must say farewell edmond and let us part  before i leave you mercds have you no request to make said the count	611.9528
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street	352.4765
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de voiture  what does you mean by boor michon said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came	1239.6062
ask him then for the written order	364.2387
they cant be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night	921.5064
he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slavea dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill  baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment	749.6736
lucullus dines with lucullus  porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner but wine was wanting the bottle was empty	770.0010
i heard it from m debray who was present at the explanation  valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer	584.3500
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercds who must believe him dead	761.0807
so young cried felton covering that hand with his kisses	1084.7598
athos my friend  and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each others arms then athos looking into his friends face and taking him by both hands said  what ails you my lord	608.4875
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet	1319.3231
oh yes was the ready answer	438.7507
thats exactly what my wife said monseigneur  do you know who carried off your wife  no monseigneur  you have suspicions nevertheless  yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them  your wife has escaped	834.2276
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead	827.4372
you are a brave fellow  as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used	895.2897
0345m    some time after it was stated that the comte de morcerf this was the name he bore had entered the service of ali pasha with the rank of instructor general	476.4634
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois	437.2495
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	1358.4996
it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the carnival	250.3278
then said dartagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do  yes said athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen  athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman	396.1519
parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it respectfully	1288.0680
when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sisters there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs  yes said valentine i will now acknowledge you are right maximilian and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young girl sorrowfully	722.9866
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour	1152.0626
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters  comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview	608.1841
and what will he promise us said dartagnan	341.3203
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans  sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and m dpinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty  at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart	624.5678
he	44.0232
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	814.7566
at nine oclock tomorrow ritas father will be here with the money  it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste	590.3428
and madame de villefort cried baptistin	1102.8267
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to davrigny and said  and now the priest  is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked davrigny	669.2341
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord  as we have before said the post chaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration	545.3074
i prize itit was given to my ancestor by king francis i in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	1440.3594
are we not eating a horse porthos	677.3331
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it	863.5877
and pray what was this quarrel about  these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door  force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose  to do her violence without doubt said athos	750.2694
in consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his visit	782.2651
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody	1272.9080
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	971.2171
doctor do you hear them call for help  yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentines room  but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening	751.6244
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends  aramis shook his head	395.6537
there still remained planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step	763.5751

for you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my son which recalled him to life almost instantaneously  30077m    oh do not place any reliance on that madame one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him	648.9831
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him	806.6448

the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	912.8397
the sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him	584.0915

it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape  i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures	422.0455
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads  albert had often heardnot from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersthe description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him	790.7574

i cannot endure the modern school of painting  you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become old  or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors  you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots  but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other	1126.9878
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowling piece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree	1507.9742
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood	1044.4307
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it  you villain will you finish cried dartagnan athoswhat has become of athos  while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside	717.1951

it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos	1299.1570
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine	849.5817
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes	647.9571
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart	797.8355
i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment	801.7663
this is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair	267.7606

five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes door	1457.1544
here he said take this pocket book  do you give it to me  yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles  then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison	367.4521
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice  yes  well then i repeat you are wrong	699.9092
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited  and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothingwithout reckoning mousquetons wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more  ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with dartagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master  in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left  and i about ten pistoles said aramis	344.9360

your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole  monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	1517.9531
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received it	651.7155
you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you	533.1450
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventy five pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the bargain	1000.6321
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis	489.0829

he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest enough  someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de winter	811.0954

outside this door a spade was placed against the wall i took it and advanced towards the thicket	552.6948

they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	510.3328

the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water	1680.4629

captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedfrom electricity lightning from lightning illumination  no replied dants	821.9539
his reflections were not very cheerful	2073.5291
what hinders it exclaimed the king	1067.5348
to present our respects to the cardinal  porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed dartagnan	497.1318
the four men stood motionless	1284.6372
she told dartagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother	438.5591

because tomorrow hayde you will be free you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours	801.3179
i cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three  therefore i only purchased two said aramis	1093.8971

he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared	813.7421
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	550.1695
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience  oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness  until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to conveywe will wait  and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness  therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actionsno more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name  morrel looked obedience to her commands	988.9442
be one or the other but not both replied porthos	317.7712
ratonneau and pomgue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the chteau dif but ratonneau and pomgue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume	1630.3448
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses	795.3547
cowardly court	755.0886
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me  but i cannot leave paris just now without knowing  aramis stopped	475.5122
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse	346.0715
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitors cross that lesser criminals were executed	1047.7498
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination	1168.1617
a large stone had served as a wedge flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice this species of masonry had been covered with earth and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the stones myrtle bushes had taken root and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth	1852.2485
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is  yes i do sir in the donjon of vincennes  yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm  sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar  then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him  but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall  sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission  no no cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement	720.3201
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoledyou the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power  danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously	1459.0143
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor	983.1089
shall you never leave me again	539.5504
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted	813.7374
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dants if only to prevent your growing weary of me	778.2537
then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword	1099.1062
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation	464.7253
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest  valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart	654.1495
what he asked athos	288.6415
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son	859.8633
0277m    pretty strong rum said dants wiping his brow with his sleeve	2307.1851
address yourself to m humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a no	2127.6819
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite  well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties	1532.5988
the following day dants presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dants residing in the alles de meilhan and also a young woman called mercds an inhabitant of the catalan village	1752.6003
i will make you another offer  what is that  i do not offer you a million because i have it not but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercds at the catalans and give her two lines from me  0120m    if i took them and were detected i should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred  well said dants mark this if you refuse at least to tell mercds i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool  threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad	362.1610
0197m      chapter 16 a learned italian  seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dants almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating	2000.0288
you shall be my body guard	808.5241
doctor davrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall	1174.5297
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactioni come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter  there was a doubtful expression in noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	385.6135
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose	622.9845
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself	1477.0872
thanks to what aramis had told him dartagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon	673.2491
you have a longboat  that in which we came  it appeared light and well constructed  quite a canoe  fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord	1206.0002
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods	1449.0682
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	529.0262
he followed m dpinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with albert and chteau renaud	839.6018
madame de villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table	963.5612
in conscience i cannot kill him and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me	1061.2039
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you  an agreeable one asked the italian	611.9525
thats against all rules	152.6748
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dants in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	887.5116
very well sir said comminges you shall hear of this anon  and you of me sir said louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest  friquet and nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects	464.4234
i congratulate you my dear m danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes  i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins	404.7477
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars	1412.1467
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england	416.0836
good morning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian  did you doubt it said the young captain	441.5945
it is enough	538.7878
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field	728.7658
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound	531.7567
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of m de trvilles entrance he turned round	432.6327
help help he murmured oh god	1295.2527
well bring it said athos	412.0357
come come signor pastrini no joking we must have a carriage  sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all i can say  and when shall we know inquired franz	724.0734
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state	386.6353
bonacieux and was expressed in these terms  there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you	447.0894
good said dartagnan rising and brushing his knees now i have theethou art a frondeur and the lover of madame de longueville     chapter x monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	981.9030
he entered and on his way met the waiter	581.6437
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret  you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily	1041.3901
you will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you  dartagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception	643.6100
they are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel  very well and youwhat will you do  ii return to paris  what without chastising this insolent boy asked the lady	295.5255
dartagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a comrade	503.5769
oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he iswhere we can find him	717.5386
still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner	658.4990
general said the president we acknowledge no king louis xviii or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason  excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge louis xviii but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france  sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us	1059.9542
and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune	840.2852
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris	467.2422
another of the number continued the abb without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me  a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbs speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards	417.2498
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door keepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	456.7536
would you like to become rich or at least independent	959.4697
all was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless	763.3745
the door opened and dartagnan went into the chamber	394.1796
a million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep	1448.3380
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening	917.8276
yes yes i see	302.1358
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door	543.2933
my hand said she	307.4110
do you not think with me m de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush  it is probable sire replied villefort	637.3201
in one second athos joined him	1037.4266
oh where will be the end  villefort rushed into the room	441.8144
the contract was read during a profound silence	1714.4414
the count withdrew his foot	1492.7188
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500000 or 600000 livres	473.3257
he looked around him and saw mme	657.3959
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure  why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then	839.0095
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign	632.9620
chapter 66 matrimonial projects  the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coup did not appear	1966.6725
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace	950.8833
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale	658.4930
no more than a drop of water in the ocean  remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow  how so inquired the abb	1057.5648
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it  bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	1868.4119
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom dartagnan had given to comminges appeared	606.5215
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing  what are you saying asked the queen	648.4575
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see  what asked athos	673.4669
it is pleasant to have such well dressed brethren and those gendarmes behaved shamefully	1538.8034
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	382.9240
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things  what did you please to say sir asked caderousse	769.1790
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there  who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	904.1937
well said the baroness	250.2153
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep  yes sire said aramis yes you are right	540.3604
i have this said he	128.1017
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord	726.8279
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise	483.9719
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	505.5221
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill dartagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of dartagnan or rather of planchet after dartagnan had saved his life	842.3279
rochefort obeyed and retired	1949.2186
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button  then i must give up the idea  no we have them ready made	812.0668
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms	1089.5035
but are you seriously wounded	1212.5706
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale  madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her sons arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count	912.2271
dear grandfather said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you  his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness	1135.7336
where are you come from sir	342.7163
do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned	478.2710
ah true said aramis	575.5209
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone	669.3060
m de trville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	473.2409
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory  when do you leave  immediately the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you	1621.7484
charming said mazarin	412.8407
continue and say what we must do now  monsieur laporte said dartagnan finish dressing his majesty  we may go then asked the queen	732.7529
porthos told him of it in his calm manner	363.6739
what say you  i cannot believe such was the case	357.3767
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	894.9682
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so  everything answered franzyour voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead  ii live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	2376.9192
marie michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest  athos paused	900.8416
will that do  capitally replied m de busigny	1999.3345
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo  is all safe and sound m morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the voyage  then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker  the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war	552.3765
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept soundly	815.9506
if you know monsieur de trville you must have visited him  often said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end	646.9630
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation  they are hot royalists said groslow	515.9370
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abb  this was the orthodox phrase	676.1965
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other sidewhat do you see	1303.4172
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay	671.4179
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	272.4429
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart	705.7320
yes replied a gendarme	1000.0716
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation	564.9604
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine	807.3145
i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them	467.6028
he arose and stood near mousqueton	2115.9939
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abb and not from the good abb himself  and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came  it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse	635.8343
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselvesfor my fortune is theirsbefore me they were nothingafter me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacityineptitude	510.9527
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	1288.0034
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed	783.3107
chapter lxxvii	1112.6313
take care my young friend	766.0638
and alone  no my lord madame has visitors  have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito  no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing  and who is with madamem	726.2414
mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key  bravo said aramis how did you manage it  like everything else with money but it cost me dear  how much asked athos	895.5996
order my lord he said i am ready to obey your eminence  monsieur dartagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign  your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor	663.1920
a keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows bird	2357.2979
you are in prison then  rochefort trembled in every limb at this question	1263.3654
well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause deathso pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars	967.2144
what can it mean said debray to franz	612.3833
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de trville is particularly attached to their majesties	256.3605
thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disobeyed baptistin bowed	1219.8549
he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him	652.5115
he crossed the court ran up the two flights to athoss apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it down	909.3498
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	833.1371
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal  monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is madenay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands  oh pray name it  i am wholly a stranger to parisit is a city i have never yet seen  is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world	1228.6957
i will await you at the corner of the rue du muse and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me  then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation  yes	631.5083
ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see  what  therethat calash filled with roman peasants  no  well i am convinced they are all charming women  how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments  oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other  but in spite of alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants	1311.6973
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	707.8465
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache	724.1038
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done	489.5510
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else	542.8749
but hark	678.0485
theres only the price we are not agreed about  how not agreed about said caderousse	734.2540
as to porthos that is certainly droll but i am not the less a giddy fool	593.8304
aramis cried athos i am arrested  good replied aramis calmly	1058.2427
i once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said i shall do but i have done so and so that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil darker and more silent even than the bastile	311.8833
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and miladys every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other  thats exactly the reason i wont go said dartagnan	618.6990
in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his blood	299.8351
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird  you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with basdry  there said the dragoon	1049.2031
but do you know where  no  in the kings room  the kings room cried athos	424.0338
are you mad to talk to me thus said buckingham	439.8568
certainly if miladys strength had been equal to her hatred mme	1294.4801
psi sign my full name for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials  the poor duke became perfectly giddy	638.1068

he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity	1249.2750
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse	409.1992

great heavens suddenly exclaimed debray	527.8556
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands	440.8378

madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album	1347.8801
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master	1322.5702
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me	1270.6599
dants strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak	787.7820
his shoulder knots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron	2377.5925

ever since valentines dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad	2050.6101
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees	915.2717
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door	1094.2799
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered  port wine  ah	1926.5115

on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint mran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor rene valentines mother	510.7993
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers  monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys  lackeys grumbled the cardinal	1189.3157
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor	1216.0458
m dpinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement   no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history	478.6750
m de trville never jested in matters relating to discipline	1076.6712

now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome  for my part dear mother interposed rene i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m de villeforts handsthen i shall be contented  just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis	757.4025
say no more about it	407.2109
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivains respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention	746.0726
no one can deny his being a noble hearted young fellow  but meanwhile continued m morrel here is the pharaon without a captain  oh replied danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dants will be set at liberty  no doubt but in the meantime  i am entirely at your service m morrel answered danglars	1097.6108

but his majestys decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours  dartagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it	860.2582
ah it is you peppino said the count	211.6494
think often of raoul	1207.5183
i sought out the best fencing master in paris i made an agreement with him to take a lesson every day and every day for a year i took that lesson	814.6451
you see said raoul we have done wisely  what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche	842.4777
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through fear	437.6846
he is cold said debray	737.1570
you see it is not my fault  and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girlsone fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar	1169.8959
danglars asked for a knife and fork	729.6101

the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude	555.0851
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god	317.5281
i beg you will remove your bandage  it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle	935.7940

long life to his eminence	389.7699
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold	1514.1765
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity	518.7984
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	409.1508
at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50000 francs left	696.4661

adieu paris adieu  his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise	773.2994
they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia  and how does he behave towards travellers  alas	332.6800

well resumed mme	1084.4705
silence then cried athos	465.1282
after a moments mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears	1030.5748

to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when dartagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered herthese were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure	593.3380
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully	2034.2903
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of dartagnan	540.3199

this concerns your head i warn you  who are you then demanded dartagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it	559.6841
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror	1524.6879
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious	760.4589
you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal	296.8678

it was time	228.5883

it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room	436.6844
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneat least so it is saidand i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeatit is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world  really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions	1754.8480
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not  certainly said morrel i am at your service count still  what  it is desirable i should know the real cause  that is to say you would rather not  no  the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side  enough said morrel who is your second witness  i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel	627.4905

nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	1147.2047
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises  a peculiar smile passed over dants lips he squeezed jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain alone	571.0906
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying  alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely	633.1929
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25000  and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked monte cristo	1138.1001
we must be expeditious	681.3992

why you strike like a blind or a deaf man  it was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours  oh mine replied dartagnan was not a man  what was it then  it was an apparition  and  i charmed it away  without further explanation dartagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu gate	512.1451

milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast	1300.8187
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs	730.2850
and wherefore should they do so	1202.7280

then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air	238.9966

so much the better	414.5134

madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say  oh that naughty child	508.3992
tell me  pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world	382.6460
to regret the world is to regret the devil that is my conclusion  and that is mine also said the curate	345.1955

why the good god sends him back again caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair	1222.9161
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be watched	1201.7570
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abb busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning	856.3019

it was round and a large divan completely encircled it	1431.2289

the anjou wine   after the most disheartening news of the kings health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward	1691.8212

she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	595.4767
danglars left	1192.1337
i recognized it on your finger  you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts asked porthos	1156.2380
anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de cond who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil in whatsoever direction it might be	1261.4264
dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms  40154m    then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder	2129.3049
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine  brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not inquired madame de villefort	623.8439
peste said dartagnan to porthos	161.1958
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen	486.4433
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms	581.3390
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him	397.7771
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice  work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind  yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cli comederunt illam  plague stifle you and your latin said dartagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted	513.5850
why that is a fortune  porthos made a most significant grimace mme	1082.2029
valentine  yes yes signed noirtier	249.5210
you are insane monsieur  monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting  and dartagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to dartagnan to serve him as a safeguard	1423.0703
that is my answer  the answer was terrible	386.4185
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will	626.3737
bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day	573.1457
quemadmodum inter clorum immensitatem  aramis cast a glance upon dartagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws	1933.8154
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	711.1820
let us see  i have told you	279.3824
on the staircase he met athos and porthos who were coming to see him	335.4106
la ramee  la ramee came into the room	1149.6049
you asked me just now if i was in funds said dartagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table	632.6865
strength and sagacity	1635.4900
ready said he with his usual curtness	801.8898
chapter xxiii	111.9389
whatever may ensue i will go  if you are determined said athos do so  but the bastille said aramis	528.1320
i say that he is ill informed	524.7069
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence	347.2690
they were rapidly leaving the chteau dif behind	1790.7115
you would like one that sails as rapidly as  lightning interrupted mordaunt	1415.9279
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them but i am unable to leave london for want of money	705.4356
albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments	1071.0626
villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage	1657.4158
lean a little to the left	131.1256
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband  but monsieur you know then  i know that you have been abducted madame  and by whom	216.1383
what have you done with her then if you have her no longer  they have abducted her monsieur  they have abducted her	355.2459
chapter 81 the room of the retired baker  the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in rue de la chausse dantin	388.0734
are you alone athos  parbleu whom do you expect to find with me at this hour  well well and dartagnan rushed into athoss chamber	441.3093
alas i have only my tongue but i will try to show that it is good for something	359.2359
she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers  ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport  that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself  you have been free to choose your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers  precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze	1692.3311
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement	2066.7908
what is his bearing  mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth	668.7924
you are afraid are you	492.1013
and the drawers  yes  those at the side  no  the middle one  yes  valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	443.8756
the attention which we have been obliged to give during the commencement of the chapter to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it has diverted us for an instant from him to whom anne of austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal and who confounded unknown lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors looked on at this scene comprehensible only to four personsthe king the queen his eminence and himself	677.8481
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet dartagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme	445.2238
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken  then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of feltonthe only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination	1157.2673
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	578.4113
wait for me here all of you cried m morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on  thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can  this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind	457.4764
he is the evil genius of both of us	514.5768
what an idea	1093.8438
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	347.5746
having accomplished these three social duties monte cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my duty now let others do theirs  andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count	1710.1818
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	354.2271
1f5	45.9661
yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post  do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly  fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathauds account  in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be softened	301.5373
that last order is useless interrupted dartagnan there are loaded pistols in your holsters  bazin sighed	2216.3662
the baroness was astonished	1530.7561
ah	98.0074
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation	662.3912
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry	1278.9244
corbleu	53.1198
the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry  not yet i think	644.0088
the valet de chambre announced m de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china	773.9663
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard  monseigneur said m de trville that will be unjust to the guardsmen	650.2996
1f4	35.3477
and the duke  furious against the cardinal	458.8193
there said he its done	376.0361
yes  in landed property  no  in stock  yes  the stock is in your own hands  the look which m noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find	796.5211
do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over	748.9573
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmarethats all	1214.5680
dartagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurators wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped	396.7253
nonsense said dartagnan you would do as much mr humanity in a battle	634.6887
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor	888.9725
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	643.1876
the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dants was surprised not to find in the outer cavern	678.5910
come in gentlemen  dartagnan obeyed for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself	539.4562
what are there no grottos at monte cristo he asked	695.9860
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came	1070.0499
athos	60.7889
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out	1038.6566
swords then cried aramis swords	1240.1017
his itinerary was promptly determined he would go to dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward soissons the other toward compiegne there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained	1327.0739
dartagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	492.6736
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still darker	454.0314
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend	447.1480
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off	2042.9719
whither are you taking me asked he	287.4208
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded	1923.5941
come tell me  she had seduced and ruined my brother a priest	840.4202
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically and why her rather than another  because a mistress is one of the cardinals favorite means he has not one that is more expeditious	575.3945
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth	1093.6858
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	911.3636
the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney	2375.7942
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket	722.7643
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest  how	753.1808
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs  oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	635.0961
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you	474.4217
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name	482.3111
dartagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without reply	819.1504
the masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors	977.2936
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate	831.3735
tis ireally i	879.7748
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms	986.7059
rene regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover	1047.3531
give me my felt hat bernouin  the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim	1491.8784
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	447.5172
in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wifes and daughters jewels and a portion of his plate	907.0359
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that charles i had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement	1427.8690
undoubtedly the call came from farias dungeon	1685.1450
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit  handsome well bred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations  how young this dartagnan is said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle	385.5303
you say m danglars dined here  yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m and madame de villefortcharming peoplem	729.3110
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche	588.7068
yes my pocket has a hole in it  oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling	703.5738
well continued she	740.7433
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat	465.1659
he immediately signalled it	1561.0834
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe	1579.3949
you see then felton i can do nothing but die	598.6235
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	439.5844
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto	2250.6667
nor you to mine cried the abb	252.3548
do you wish for a name	254.3993
well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal	322.4285
and i also said dartagnan i also	336.4962
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up	648.6851
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devotee	1145.5664
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other	1630.5205

it is long since we have had a good dinner and i for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry i confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy  agreed as to the old burgundy i have no objection to that said aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of conversion	645.8265
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent	1517.9762
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her	759.4993
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful  is it still only an intention your eminence asked dartagnan	338.2003
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me	1306.3766

in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends	862.5535
beware monsieur there is certainly some magic underneath  meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter	758.6987
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine	1276.7053
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	494.3748
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it  the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	579.0709
apropos	61.0213
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night there	1252.9917
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i dont know how many rochellais  did you inquire the names of those three musketeers  yes monseigneur  what are their names  messieurs athos porthos and aramis  still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal	835.0112
i am from gascony it is true and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done  monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel	370.3441
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed	901.3895
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight  what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	1310.7990
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit and in his enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight	634.5649
the company looked at each other in consternation	1614.1686
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you  my love for you	684.1589
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far	1213.4434
mademoiselle danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	1542.3964
if at this moment the sweet voice of rene had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercds had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness	895.7918
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt	440.2004
during this time dants at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests	825.4322
yes	31.0132
but vampa raised his head proudly as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold	1366.1265
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck	1007.6855
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared  the count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish	425.8583
indeed you could not belong to him	287.5871
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him	1226.5469
the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead	1135.3807
onward cried porthos	660.8853
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do  but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop	562.7885
chapter lx	673.4076
mordaunt reappeared	1282.0739
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward  true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustshamefully unjust	445.2762
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road	743.1235
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her	760.1809
the king entertained great regard for my father who had fallen at the siege of arras and the uniform was granted	678.9117
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris	498.1079
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand	644.2978
lead two sheep to the butchers two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy	1063.0488
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did  why so inquired dants	704.2196
but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m de jussac turned the corner of the convent	755.2717
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming  the puritan then went out	670.0405
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes	577.7319
three is just my number  now then who are you asked the englishman	419.4922
gentlemen said athos a wager  ah wooi a vager cried the swiss	1478.0051
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine  but in what carriage do we start  i have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty  let us go to the king  dartagnan bowed and followed the queen	1053.6321
good to eat he said and put it in his pocket	248.8305
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will  no  sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses	296.0856
but on my soul it looks so	671.2543
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her dartagnan would have returned home since he had so promised	341.9044
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble light	902.9067
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan  thank you sirthank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world  debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame  madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her	958.4380
i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure	997.9156
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars  wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina	678.1708
well  having then a keeper like la ramee i should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight  come come said la ramee thats not a bad idea  capital isnt it	685.3660
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me  i do better than that siri save you  you do	549.5185
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it your majesty has treated her with a severity  it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them  the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife	681.8781
us laws alone swamp our small staff	250.1545
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely dartagnan his captaincy porthos his barony	1170.8619
monsieur said m de trville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair  i have no objection replied m de la trmouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers  you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said trville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you  make it monsieur i listen  how is monsieur bernajoux your esquires relative  why monsieur very ill indeed	393.8517
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil  27 rue du helder on the 21st may half past ten am     chapter 39 the guests  in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion	1326.0275
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you  albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	468.3472
no	59.2899
have you the money he demands  yes all but eight hundred piastres  the count went to his secrtaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself  you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz	651.9691
this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen	391.2729
poor queen already fallen	589.4617
the pates were excellent the wine delicious	228.1628
apropos my lord	446.2661
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance	756.0197
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order	500.4604
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	1057.9965
bonacieux	26.0666
twenty four years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country	1147.4027
no sir  i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church  he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	403.9191
how do you think these garments fit me  wonderfully said dartagnan but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better  what asked porthos	644.4435
no replied mousqueton parry kept it	1960.8397
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon	449.5706
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on	1364.0748
thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want now it is for me to perform my promise	427.9407
but unfortunately i must wait  40138m    you must wait for what asked caderousse	1183.0420
he took to his heels and was soon at m de trvilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de trvilles office	508.1302
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own	766.4909
if you take one step farther dartagnan said he we shall cross swords together  dartagnan sank on his knees and prayed	870.6042
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child	765.5336
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped	430.9544
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	2018.3939
listen morrelit is noon if valentine is not now dead she will not die  how so cried morrel when i left her dying  monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead	1096.5098
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles	1095.0770
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this i have the proofs  she was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force	393.0104
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate  dartagnan drew up his request and m de trville on receiving it assured him that by two oclock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers	455.4997
i thought they might be useful so i took them  meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols	1352.0115
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia	69.5543
ay said he i see but you shall not kill me today	314.7095
never sell it allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age and if you make a campaign with it take as much care of it as you would of an old servant	779.5190
go now at once or i shall have you put out  i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty	340.9358
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme	795.5839
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that dartagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	728.3552
since my brothers assassination in the streets of nmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard	447.5906
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table	1003.0110
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mothers admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature	917.3800
then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break it	665.0997
it was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement	1156.7725
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise  and the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure	596.7120
no i would join the escort  athoss eyes shone with joy	1413.7024
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all  with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room	626.9478
tell me quickly my time is not my own  monsieur said dartagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it  it is indeed a favor young man replied m de trville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe	655.8517
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercds in the world and he might yet be happy	351.0279
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited	665.7220
with one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet  fifty feet responded dants almost terrified	740.9528
well said cucumetto have you executed your commission  yes captain returned carlini	1454.0844
oh my god my god	404.1283
who was the invisible chief	792.5139
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us  his voice went to my heart observed julie and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before     chapter 51 pyramus and thisbe  about two thirds of the way along the faubourg saint honor and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the wide spreading chestnut trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of louis xiii	640.7133
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything	489.1562
listen	39.6055
that nobleman was you it was his father  hush	555.2587
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake  what happened during the night asked beauchamp of chteau renaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here  in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron	940.5664
do you hear it	278.8044
they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak	663.4217
what the devil could that handkerchief signify  placed where he was dartagnan could not perceive the face of aramis	511.9731
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward  the money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied danglars	647.2802
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles  well monseigneur  all the details of his coming into and going out of the palaceon the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune telleryou will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears deaths heads and crossbonesfor in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending  is that all monseigneur  tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance  i will tell him that  tell him further that i hold montague in my power that montague is in the bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know  exactly  then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of r forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france	234.9708
what a misfortune  he had been informed at seven oclock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to miladys chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution dartagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton	641.1755
why do you remember when it forgets	1178.2994
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m morrels salon	984.0535
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace	725.8658
after dinner the play  monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests	1427.5299
that would spoil my plans  sir said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten minutes are almost up i must return to my post	1413.8182
the queen stopped him	775.5497
persons whom i do not like  yes indeed	399.7815
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	343.9149
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	377.7167
woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy  on yourself then unhappy man on yourself  i am the only guilty person am i not said maximilian	649.3772
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet	748.0107
the counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand	1402.0656
they were perhaps in league with him  oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m	969.5060
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris	1392.8325
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes	735.9758
aramis obeyed	1198.3507
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn	233.6944
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said danglars	1400.2610
yes i wish to speak to him  valentine durst not oppose her grandmothers wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards villefort entered	637.1773
the french ladies madame	338.5407
20311m    he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes	589.7770
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into lifevalentine the daughter by my first wifemademoiselle rene de saint mranand edward the boy whose life you have this day saved  and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo	830.2211
well demanded dartagnan	1891.2015
have you not yet divined who he is  what cried felton heagain healways he	1262.4553
strength and sagacitycontinued	1666.6692
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	555.5720
on the contrary observed dartagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible  how so  it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england  well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army	620.5397
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti monte cristo was for an instant alone	414.7489
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude  you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first  we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham	343.4101
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	1918.0254
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre but jest as he might he gained nothing	1385.8711
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	346.7902
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used up	529.7388
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly	1217.4174
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as dartagnan says will carry the letter  well said cried aramis you dont often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth	1208.2417
and what is your choice asked jussac	1296.0786
as for that m morrel said he again turning his quid as for that  as for what  the money  well  well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest  thanks my friends thanks cried morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so  these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman	366.0216
very well	685.3588
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	368.6129

and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor  20139m    under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	373.5208

here he said here is a draft at sight  and here is your fowl  danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost	709.6644

her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	1554.7159
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it and that is why on account of the living mercds and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand andi have revenged myself  and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that  i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali	450.9658
and moreover my dear child continued dartagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian  i do not understand you sir said raoul	957.6925
he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass	1341.9620
but now you are happy  doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain  and your present happiness has it softened your heart  my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	883.3992
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	480.7078
in that case i will forgive him  and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him	995.7557
save the queen cried mazarin to the coadjutor	281.0658
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me  have you mentioned this death in your paper  it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it  still said chteau renaud dr	635.9855
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours time he stopped before a little isolated house	555.4526
hey friend cried the duke	386.4828
the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons	636.2652

devil of a man corsican that you arealways mysteries or superstitions	2134.2114
we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay  go go exclaimed dants	834.9263
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board	521.3127
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her	1438.0508
as he passed by m noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further	843.7361

at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	755.5895
let us sit down  villefort fell rather than seated himself	1944.9015
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance	1581.6461
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing	420.7348
dants half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent	1359.8606
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given dartagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	596.6776
ah i understand	417.4552
one of the last as you see if you hear anything of monsieur voiture be so kind as to send me word to morrow  oh said scarron he may die now  why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes	413.2174
hayde was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing room	536.7950
i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime  this is not to the purpose said eugnie let us speak candidly sir i admire candor  oh said danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice	575.4767

the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door	590.5577
life itself may be resolved into three words erat est fuit  which means said dartagnan who began to suspect the truth	1802.3217
it was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour	593.8684

but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid allwere it my life  oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments i also have had dreams	775.7949
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence  perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box  which box do you mean asked the countess	465.4588
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy  it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one i admit but very necessaryhave you any money  something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoula young man must live respectably	760.4825
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides	1066.1267
we will talk italian and spanish	1337.2538
ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty  he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare	1001.3289

the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done me  no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england  then you dont know me sir  it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you  and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me  none i swear to you  there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured	2097.9080
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require  this manner of acting roused much respect for dartagnans policy among the musketeers	350.5364
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much noise	1225.7557
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark	1048.0621

each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy	622.4613
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first timethis garden the actual scene of my crimemust have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause	709.4996
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers  thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after alberts departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy	857.6693
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence	151.6099

formerly a brewer replied the gascon	984.6247
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son  ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious  it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love  but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son  how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested  valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	493.0209

she is gone said he she must have returned to the louvre  you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out  no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman  is the young guardsman at home  i do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters  all the same it is well to be certain  how so  by knocking at his door	303.3938
i hate you and on my word you shall pay for this  at the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise her head and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried dear madame bonacieux open for me the little door on the alley and i will come down to you     chapter xviii	382.3259

well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone  oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream  the jeweller smiled	603.3939
look emmanuel then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill albertthe unhappy youth has a mother  you are right said monte cristo and i have none these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder	298.8431

a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs	410.1914
chapter xxxix	96.2447
let us drink my dear dartagnan morbleu let us drink while the wine is fresh	1402.8473
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy nilly	1649.8413
porthos i doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers  it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly	674.2294
god grant you as much	795.9683

106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker	953.7332
quick said a voice at the end of the gallery	198.6984
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel	533.3354
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period	713.7480
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight  no noby no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground	519.4281

but what can be the matter	337.9861
we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere	749.7047
the next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and would be friend the count of monte cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time	679.2310
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felons life might live as other men	415.0971
monsieur dartagnan	285.1130
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son	749.4370
at the same time continued dartagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey  yes indeed said porthos	635.5375
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me	415.5058
a cloud passed over his brow as he said  no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	375.0228
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abb unusual privileges	1153.1465
but that is not all madame	197.8091
tis like a duel	1096.5244
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained	1060.8542

there are the acts signed i deliver them to you without compulsion	1278.3947
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor	725.6055
tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken	1101.0665
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	650.0104
no one better  speak out then say what it was  gaspard cried la carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice youll hold your tongue  well wife replied caderousse i dont know but what youre right  so you will say nothing asked the abb	554.5692
oh my dear friend if this be the caseif you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoleddo not complain  count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arms of a friend	1037.8263
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left m de villeforti intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house	2031.7969
and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gateto be close to you without really seeing youhave i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength	911.3266
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms  my dear countwhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money	1483.1250
what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful  i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions  my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness	543.6398
you have taken your revenge for the rue frou and even exceeded it you ought to be satisfied  if your majesty is so said trville we are  oh yes i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of dartagnan	751.2585
he soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	1838.1479
many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself	726.3938
when a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong	547.9684
this time there could be no doubt dartagnan was really insulted	764.6343
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs lyses is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up	442.1169
the baron came forward	84.9845
we have arrested monsieur de beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them	673.6229
why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin	405.6812
messrs	67.6432
my brother is only your second husband and your first is still living	651.4821
at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase	806.4368
felton abandon me	1972.0270
danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips	1056.0817
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband	587.9236
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing	827.0014
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	1282.4615
he my thief replied dartagnan	821.6764
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it  i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois  probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord  at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	926.8718
madame de villefort is ill  50087m    but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse	1644.7357
yes if my friends agree  but if they refuse can i count on you  i have never accomplished anything alone said dartagnan shaking his head	687.4201
what is the matter sir asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner	866.0088
the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting post	723.7289
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir	900.3139
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and bound	1130.4032
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	963.4050
that is our brave musketeer i think said the cardinal	477.1316
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert	469.5445
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	618.1025
your age said the president will you answer that question  i will answer that question as well as the rest mr president but in its turn  your age repeated the president	407.5347
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair	1795.8936
come in here said davrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay	450.3072
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite	848.4520
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	589.0718
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child  here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted	912.9673
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one	621.1816
pardon me monsieur but you are not  my lord the duke of buckingham said mme	284.2541
this was granted	1680.8516
as the carriage stopped at the door and albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter	364.2943
just so  why he is a second ariosto  no his name is the count of monte cristo  there is no count of monte cristo said debray	384.0899
but to return to our millions  certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world	453.2205
where did you place it	269.9825
oh	40.0570
sit down and i will read it again  albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend	620.9992
one of them went away and dants heard his shoes striking on the pavement	802.9328
only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a days separation	542.5043
coquenard	79.6932
one night more and he would be on his way	262.5923
he probably had succumbed	1282.8339
listen replied felton in a low voice	519.8506
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	1812.0627
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux  thats true	1035.6571
it was the plan of alexander vi	1245.0710
and with my grandfathers consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you  valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them	899.6148
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation	1053.0967
she sat down took edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom	894.3718
no one at villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	1240.6908
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by dartagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villars cotterets	777.6794
you do not like dants  i never like upstarts  then tell me all you know about the catalane  i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries  what have you seencome tell me  well every time i have seen mercds come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin  really and you think this cousin pays her attentions  i only suppose so	658.9030
athos dwelt in the rue frou within two steps of the luxembourg	1175.6599
signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted	805.7776
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will  he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	527.5803
is he not your friend replied the baron negligently	558.6400
remain here	813.2886
alas said milady i know it is so	231.1912
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution	1628.3473
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres	2131.8459
oh if so punish me as you will but do notdo not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained  hayde replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free  free to do what asked the young girl	624.0108
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbs cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this  when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue	682.6377
no louise no	857.1595
i misunderstood you	1010.9290
the duc delbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others	419.4726
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond	694.3472
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes	2321.1252
she believed the order ready for execution	1209.7250
ha said rochefort you are right	433.3524
you see monsieur what the new world has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe	305.4299
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light	1234.2283
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	1146.7758
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercds and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to herbe assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first  however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dants was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence	477.9422
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head	1777.7101
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned  the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly  let him come in then said the cardinal quickly	313.9064
and for whomfor some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison	2389.3557
hold see	549.5977
raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud	938.9061
the servant soon returned	2009.4188
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	1700.2684
thats lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders	1660.2776
pronounce one single word muttered dartagnan and you are a dead man  the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring	473.3124
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived	927.2798
on tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night	1419.4073
theres another brave and excellent young man  do you know him asked the officer	510.8672
morrel was mad	843.5233
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead	604.0077
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me  why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need  the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	1077.9309
chapter xii	1068.4626
we are on the very eve of it	290.6092
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps i should not hesitate	505.5505
i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens aramis will follow us by that of noyon as to dartagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchets clothes while planchet will follow us like dartagnan in the uniform of the guards  gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair	470.5295
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning  in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	461.8575
the cavalcade trotted on more sharply	66.9891
you have seen my dear alberti ask the question as a motheryou have seen m de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be  what does he appear to be  why you have just saida man of high distinction  i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such  but what is your own opinion albert  i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese  i do not ask you of his origin but what he is  ah	1036.6809
get in laporte  laporte obeyed	180.0906
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him  there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs	1917.0771
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heavens name	1268.4329
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	1015.9072
here is monsieur comminges said dartagnan returning to the cardinal	374.4392
no accident has happened to him  none sir  and he lives  still at the hotel of the great charlemagne  and passes his time  sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse	539.7107
alexander vi	1447.1163
1f5	35.4114
this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal	459.0666
yes sir replied mousqueton	1309.4044
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine	687.1445
the point aimed at by every poniard	936.4570
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand	1583.9276
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea	1628.9095
certainly said monte cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise i would not fight with m de morcerf	1211.6382
beware my lord you are in the hands of god  in the hands of the devil you mean cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting	238.6131
they were thus perpetually employedfaria that he might not see himself grow old dants for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night	1334.4885
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	474.1320
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	713.3182
but after he had gone about two hundred steps dartagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle	927.3125
come come said maximilian i will serve as your guide such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant	380.2502
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart	1128.5710
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely virgins	1348.1461
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints	644.3618
whither does your excellency desire to be driven  to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chausse dantin  this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage drive	1198.5396
at nine oclock then be ready here at the htel i will come and take you  planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse	525.9925
it is almost dinner time and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my too devoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which i am in a fair way never to get done	963.8962
20167m    as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour  franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre	211.3079
yes sir  and it was a fierce one  his highness the prince charged eleven times in person  he is a great commander bragelonne  he is a hero sir	510.3481
the prisoner himself is named edmond dants mate on board the three master the pharaon trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to morrel  son of marseilles  before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines  oh no monsieur he is very young  how old  nineteen or twenty at the most  at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was m morrel	1575.9337
the juncture was favorable	1102.9608
every one likes his own uniform best my lord  myself excepted and again mazarin smiled for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours  lord bless us	997.7229
after giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took alberts arm	1224.4922
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	593.7792
i do  in that case i will go  and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations	736.2651
do you know that monsieur  the king commands it madame excuse me  i will not suffer it	430.2401
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat	436.7592
another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder	1553.1295
he recognized the influence of mercds and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless	909.2415
you would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to paris  oh my god	429.1841
dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	480.3098
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again  ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it	365.9846
from that moment he grew very guarded	970.2724
he had found in m de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company	641.9216
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them  is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness  they do indeed	602.3740
on guard then monsieur on guard  bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice	613.9139
you are perhaps a tulip fancier  my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so	713.5465
finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid	605.1123

what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish	643.8494
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced	476.7506
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemys entire army	825.6672
valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell	536.7946

but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him	1205.9198
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world  you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them  really said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment	313.5368
at six oclock lord de winter came in	814.3282
20057m    maximilian smiled	74.9803
hayde said he you well know  why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young greek	895.3191
exactly  and you have that letter of the cardinal said dartagnan	126.1597
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace	418.3036
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse	479.2887
the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers  and how far back into the past do your recollections extend  i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners  and how old were you at that time  i was three years old said hayde	2014.5045
m davrigny smiled sadly	1282.3649
then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel	836.2975
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt	720.1830
you heard m de villefort talking to m davrigny about the death of m de saint mran and that no less surprising of the countess	538.2742
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive dartagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire  i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but  but what asked anne of austria	477.1728
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert	1189.5312
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	596.3693
mr	12.1889
it is for me to give orders here and not you  monsieur replied dants proudly it was only to summon assistance for you  i want none it was a temporary indisposition	459.9391
bonacieux	57.5242
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and pale	548.5182
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	522.4049
i recognized your name in it	405.0022
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time	832.3271
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price  yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it  you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body	1750.0073
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead  go sir count replied dartagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england	308.8814
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray	1232.7856
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away	625.1008
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair	1692.3545
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo  pardieu everyone exists  doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses  have you seen the greek mistress  i have both seen and heard her	362.8616
the duchess is at tours and the duke at boulogne	691.3121
you were going to drink my wine  to the health of the king monsieur i was going to drink a small glass of it if fourreau had not told me i was called  alas said fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror i wanted to get him out of the way that i might drink myself  gentlemen said dartagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day i beg of you  the two guardsmen courteously accepted dartagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired	304.8852
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys command	1442.7191
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	965.5891
thank god you have come  eh	796.6202
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abb	749.0773
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de trville	680.9079
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon	1717.8440
it was however too late albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the bankers study	662.3561
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle	533.1960
be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the cellar	645.9100
you must look out for yourself  what have i to fear replied dartagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties  everything believe me	303.8936
that he has given the diamond to us only inquired caderousse half bewildered with joy yes nothing more true	840.8727
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which edmond had concealed from all others	1301.4088
i cannot speak latin responded the marquise	1467.5586
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him	745.3582
the boat is waiting for us come  besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time	1169.1096
the former dants proposed to augment the latter to remedy	1603.1135
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of ityouyes ifaith youre rightthose delicate yet firm set lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart	2276.5063
and now you will do me a favor will you not  what is it  do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed	289.0470
he left the saucepan	1410.3949
whom  the man we are seeking  it seems said dartagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries  come replied the same lofty tone answer	375.6739
friends  well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible	561.8848
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him	715.6169
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight  and dartagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper	635.2255
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other  i dont say exactly answered the gascon confused	310.5576
come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us  hold your tongue will you said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor	472.0514
coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal	832.7642
his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable  dec	1767.3091
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	783.2181
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	1690.5438
27 repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abb answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name	403.3786
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	2339.4648
are you going to rejoin your cardinal	597.8538
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught	1041.1980
i carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure one  no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england  oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued he	789.5905
with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached	772.9403
the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oclock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon	999.9410
you were saying this were you not  well i own it  i will answer you  villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual  there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his deskwhen they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die	516.6381
however i had better find him out first since he cant want money	849.8943
in a dungeon  which  good lord	742.2647
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you  you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	583.9611
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	750.4022
morbleu you must know something about it	444.7510
i wrote verses in the style of benserade  you my lord  yes i shall i repeat to you some of my verses  just as you please my lord	548.3417
there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point  cedant arma tog said villefort with a bow	2117.8291
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt	532.2864
like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day	1529.8024
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when dartagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal	487.7201
how absurdas if one crown were not as good as another	936.1921
the host drew back and burst into tears	1716.6125
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls heart	1423.4463
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which dartagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence	932.0439
what can he be looking for thought edmond	635.4805
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father	269.4746
have you really met with some great misfortune  oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustainednothing worth mentioning i assure you  true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit  it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900000 francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood  30183m    what do you say said the count 900000 francs	606.2164
on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced	871.5574
follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps  wait an instant said the host number 3 has two staircasesinside and outside  good said the brigadier	1339.0135
you have spurs  yes but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away	799.1418
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors	1212.4855
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	113.0816
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears  i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so  the signs just now and the holy water	341.4200
my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my fortune	955.2907
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	546.1922
near the barrels stood selim my fathers favorite whom i mentioned to you just now	911.1202
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man  what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion	693.3715
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late	286.2336
sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver  how is that mousqueton	1359.2596
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys	1088.7365
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	454.9985
my god  at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened several men rushed into the chamber	573.3483
what said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after another  dartagnan felt the truth of this reproach	574.7722
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin	945.5132
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person	820.4056
ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by another  where is he then  in the cellar  the cellarwhat cellar  our landlords to be sure	463.2302
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun	1349.3469
oh added a third voice the shrouds of the chteau dif are not dear  0257m    perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf  they may give him the honors of the sack  edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said	683.1743
signed el kobbir  that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it  near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor	813.8764
an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself	880.2889
when you come to paris i will return all this  i will not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit	421.8483
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband	353.9443
is monsieur dartagnan there  yes madame in your oratory	739.2087
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	1229.3867
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders	826.6777
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them	561.2363
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercds was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	640.8343
i adopt all customs speak all languages	1085.1612
chapter 111 expiation  notwithstanding the density of the crowd m de villefort saw it open before him	1696.0844
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others	687.9018
my god	1062.5183
my faith it was time that idea came into porthoss head	876.6212
are you waiting for him underneath these windows	1061.6493
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say	1256.6176
a few seconds afterward dartagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword	1193.7900
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girls arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile  my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child	1248.9230
i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman  you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal  oh no certainly not  well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me  but this secret is not mine and i cannot reveal it in this manner  you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan with chagrin	492.9224
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically	366.7295
do as you think best dartagnan  at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther	307.5345
pre pamphile more wine  and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	1455.6959
now go down said the abb folding his arms	756.6152
well said athos	214.5196
i was about to say to these gentlemen added he that i forbid my musketeers to expose their lives needlessly for brave men are very dear to the king and the king knows that his musketeers are the bravest on the earth	842.5183
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishmentinstead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsinstead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom	1597.0099
the president rang the bell	2439.2993
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone	723.3807
at the noise made by dartagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world	406.5398
i have given you all i have and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack  but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time  yes but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london  i answer for bazin said aramis	219.7432
long swords but light purses	1100.1144
 you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free         distribution of project gutenberg works	1718.1079
in the first instance to marseilles madame  to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	740.8436
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable	1196.1051
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs	713.3757
never	66.4879
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern  light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling  then addressing dartagnan  you know the watchword he said	446.6911
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you	337.9395
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together	934.8084
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m dpinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed	440.1348
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall see him	721.4482
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius  recall le plessis bellievre villequier and derlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys	1780.8407
but you are unable to oppose themyou whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself	1120.5944
now as these street arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of thomson  french	1913.3667
you incline me to think so said the king	358.4970
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate	1081.0697
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount  willingly  then it is settled  yes but where  i have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature	654.4331
dants would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	1191.2721
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements	488.7414
i know these airs i myself came to paris with four crowns in my purse and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me i was not in a condition to purchase the louvre  dartagnans bearing became still more imposing	719.2101
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard	1078.3673
no my lord these places are bought	1935.7242
with your belt my lord replied la ramee	1373.4164
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the popes decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal	1414.0428
i will shape it out for you with my knife  and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	502.3863
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	495.6234
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer	552.1027
oh yes scoundrel	1173.6834
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard	1671.5154
the count of monte cristo had just entered	508.0085
thats what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio	1057.0117
30339m    the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain	1190.0531
it was then that dartagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it	590.7450
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis	594.2970
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	824.1638
i have corrected the vices that i had i have assumed the virtues that i had not	460.9152
ah	40.4709
albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man	1156.6577
in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life	605.3478
planchet called his masters attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces	617.4424
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation	684.8469
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed	895.9268
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended	1478.2954
bonacieux it is a man i dont know although he seems to be coming here	382.0941
you must require such a user to return or destroy all         copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue         all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg         works	1280.2644
he is at my house  come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us	899.4235
see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count	292.3060
i think not replied chteau renaud	1298.1129
dartagnan therefore followed mme	911.3827
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force	1301.6980
valentine looked at her watch	704.3453
help comrades help  by a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived dants sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat	1947.3568
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles and from fromelles she had set out for armentires	935.8007

in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking	679.4853
why  just remember what they said	686.2932

ah cried valentine suddenly i understand	1052.3888
well thought dartagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my faultfor it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage  without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him	585.5197

no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the disputea proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse	782.1082
my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish	746.3515
yes for an instant i hoped it was so	375.6477
youve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven	712.0941

i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	375.9821
this is something new replied the king	428.6455
silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came  but where and when shall i see you again cried dartagnan	407.7668

i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i wasthe count of spada	712.6091
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner	274.1458
a woman with athos	458.9823
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf	374.3820
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall	238.3583
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender	679.8272
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution  ah said athos how much time we have lost  now said the king give the word and let us start  will you not give it sire asked athos	860.0139

at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips	655.5788
and so my friends we return to paris	399.5494
you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom i am obliged to live	1381.5299
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor	1784.7377
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view	1397.9473
besides the woman wore that black mantle which dartagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer	723.4943
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one	1585.4525
as for m de trville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment	330.4723
ah exclaimed davrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery	465.6088
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind	1837.2831
it was day	302.8370
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother	698.9089
peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales	1546.3716
albert recognized the bearer	1104.4434

a saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter	1374.9156
oh i am guilty then you will not pardon me  the monk recovered his usual expression	655.9008
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him	471.1509
we know him said athos he never left the king  yes that is he	238.9809
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with	803.2495
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	1061.9581
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted	467.0992
tell hayde said he that i will take coffee with her and give her to understand that i desire permission to present one of my friends to her  ali bowed and left the room	423.3421
i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty  on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says  i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners	593.1284
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa	465.2815
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it  and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	469.9900
what are your excellencys orders inquired gaetano	69.6540
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departednot however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter	1751.5493
noirtier rue coq hron no	1292.7102
it was quite dark and no one saw them go out	533.1140
aramis returned home and athos and dartagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire	1818.6458

this demon goutthis demon gout  my lord said athos we are just arrived from england and our first concern is to inquire after your health  thanks gentlemen thanks	1843.5533
the words that parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive	563.6409
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemmathe one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold	1356.2827
without doubt she murmured	1520.8932
m noirtier again closed his eyes	1005.5587
every instant mme	323.6410
go and look for the comte de la fere i wish to speak with him  aramis found athos and brought him	423.8675
this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieus former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea	1271.6467
bravo bravi brava the banker was enthusiastic in his applause	822.9535
a friend maximilian and who is this friend	345.3946
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	774.1956
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards	1850.9250
for my part said dartagnan i say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle	442.8057
caderousse rose	1264.0846
let us hear	1245.3234
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations	2034.6598
but the first was repugnant to him	242.7341
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saint mran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy	492.4001
well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope  you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part  i am indeed rejoiced said andrea	629.8122
her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly  edmond edmond edmond     chapter 113 the past  the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercds probably never to behold her again	925.6912
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one  its true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it  the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist	655.3078
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look	592.6149
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m bonacieux	671.3126
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney	545.7140
let us follow him said de guiche it will be the surest plan  i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne	548.7950
he must know where his master is  without a doubt he must  dartagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out	374.8770
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin	1215.8719
but my fears were this time ill founded i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded	1027.3806
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nmes	1117.8315
mercds has no fortune i have none to settle on her	581.2536
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger  what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host	759.7166
truly this is an indignity  be kind enough to pardon me madame but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs	491.1515
the duke meanwhile recovered his self control	1522.0350
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti  when will it take place  on saturday  m	1071.5010
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me  but youll die of hunger said the patron	1286.7175
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended	1378.8214
oh i have done well	327.6977
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary  i said the queen	1594.8297
ah thats true said athos	844.3345
at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat	363.0340
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence	517.5613
now said dartagnan ive one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges  at your service sir  you will see the count again  to morrow morning  will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained  you want the cardinal to come here  no i know my place and am not so presumptuous	519.8893
during dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage	646.9241
we will arrange the matter rather better	1398.1940
davrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the room	357.3654
one window was lighted	1498.9120
in which we hear tidings of aramis	897.4083
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st denis or in the fair of st germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom dartagnan had often remarked this	559.4104
anne of austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her	834.5725
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start	665.6797
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment	1192.0109
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other	1179.0142
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues	950.5292
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint mran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	641.3754
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers	496.9803

only as our gascon was not easily intimidatedor rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fearhe placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty	719.1608
here we are said monte cristo it is only half past ten oclock come in  certainly i will  my carriage shall take you back  no thank you i gave orders for my coup to follow me  there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage	570.3486
at these words he gave me a ring	569.1993
well then porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns	575.2219
30139m    if you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the others shoulder	452.2253
i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept	772.3331
chapter liv	717.8158
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand	816.4348
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him	684.5338
help cried he	235.2642
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	1314.0762

faria smiled	167.3171
well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman hayde my slave thinks me a greek	1569.3594
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped	1669.9395
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers	1122.7975
aramis and his thesis   dartagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurators wife	344.9104
what are his means of existence	572.7864
i have no influence with any one	506.8882
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the htel of m de trville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by dartagnana circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey	676.7510

the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples	2419.7258
write my lord he said	205.1859
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the chteau but exhausting his strength	1732.1348

chapter 46 unlimited credit  about two oclock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his featuresa person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porters lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within	930.6633

ah ah said the listener not through doors but through windows	1105.0344

then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	1283.1931
and how did he treat you  with more of mildness than severity  did you tell him your whole story  i did  and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination  he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape	833.7360

at ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day	931.0947
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color	1428.4335

at last dartagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and dartagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	1408.5756
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for dartagnan and an ace for himself	553.8813
and such magnificent hair	1242.6866
