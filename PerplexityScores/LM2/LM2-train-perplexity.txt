this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	14.6090
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga	102.8489

who says this aramis is not a wit	70.0775
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is  then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentines room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a blood red color	46.9056

he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated	32.1861

he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache	67.7665
what happened then she asked	98.8719

take my wealth my fortune my glory all the days i have to live for such an instant for a night like that	52.4185
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape	104.2143
villeforts only answer was a stifled groan	27.5624
yes sirwho is ita woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor	18.7911
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themon the fragments of all the hope which god had given them	103.7390

i should injure the queen instead of serving her  well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusala distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen  rochefort smiled contemptuously	75.2808
monsieur duke i must have those letters  sire notwithstanding  monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them  i would however beg your majesty to observe  do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will	163.9468
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speechwhich embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be freeso fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and thisthis is my fortunenot chimerical but actual	43.6533
the signatures were perfectly legal	57.3586
just as they were sitting down to table m de monte cristo arrived	10.9472
dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer	26.3725
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror	29.1571
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	139.7388
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule	78.3532
no this is his blood  where were you then  where you left meunder the scaffold  did you see it all  no but i heard all	48.8405
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gunpowder	13.2458
just heaven what have i read cried the duke	61.4307

yes  but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony  yes  you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son noirtier made no answer	37.2919
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret	21.9885

valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	26.9528
this was groslow	140.6958
at this movement mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight	24.8881
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter	41.9374
well now listen  we are listening  it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him	73.2691
bonacieux	15.2792
oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answersoon  and do you said valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa  yes cried morrel make haste	32.0015
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married mme	33.4659
dartagnan thought it was proper to follow this example	40.2316
ah really this is magnificent	162.5491
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire  that is to say replied dartagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it	43.2478
so much the better	2.6861
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	39.1415
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful  thank you madame said mazarin	41.1735
monsieur said dartagnan you must excuse famished travelers	10.8686
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to pistache  let us go on to another of his exercises  gentlementhere was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed themdo you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs	58.6546
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed	31.8599
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dants feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention	22.7018
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	11.7600
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there	46.3293
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed	111.9443

good heavens	14.4571
porthos bowed to his friend	18.4726
you must have much reason to complain of him  not very much said dartagnan	23.9661
there were two doors he bolted them both	24.9375
speak or no absolution  the dying man collected all his forces	26.5811
after living forty years with the marquis  it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	219.1566
the apartment of m bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinals people	44.7134
dants had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek	32.7976
oh my god my god cried mme	8.5103
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass	47.8348
no	91.6113
i live because it is not ordained for me to die	33.8892
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony  20207m    ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you  it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with them  what conditions have i forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it	262.3104
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	29.3301
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful	30.2716
every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture	25.3692
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart	27.6851
it was five oclock in the afternoon i ascended into the red room and waited for night	25.6440
albert followed him with the count	13.2827
i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself  the doctor pressed valentines hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps	25.3479
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children	53.0297
the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china	10.6880
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries  but to do this he must have spoken  he has done better than thathe has made himself understood  how was such a thing possible  by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury  my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil  good morning madame said the count bowing	220.9344
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dants surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	25.9583
come aramis  and we porthos said dartagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal  and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action  dartagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort	91.5844
i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la rserve the day before i was to marry you a man named danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman fernand himself posted  monte cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty huethis he placed in the hands of mercds	50.3927
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly	55.4628
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path  ah	28.4983
on his left was porthos whilst dartagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side	38.7860
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror	50.7027
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinals cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation	79.5654
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	80.4655
chevalier said athos	9.2848
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i cannot say that i have seen anything extraordinary	35.3498
it is all in beginning	85.3091
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day	69.3072
ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court	24.4588
are these persons then so rich and powerful  do you not know their history  i do not	34.1806
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	27.4352
me	19.3539
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	178.5419
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself	64.9663
in straffords company said mordaunt tauntingly	26.9676
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to dants the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also	79.0060
athos and dartagnan watched their approach from the window	33.3589
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos	27.3911
i will call salvieux and make him write the letter  be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour  tell your coachman to stop at the door  you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle rene whom i leave on such a day with great regret  you will find them both here and can make your farewells in person  a thousand thanksand now for the letter  the marquis rang a servant entered	136.6420
giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility dants proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop	39.6678
the abb sank upon edmonds bed while edmond himself remained standing	58.8793
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties	52.9389

what man is that cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive	25.2331
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side	20.2920
in that hotel	126.8947
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much  after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said  i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort	30.7526
i should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	48.3662
cries of death	13.1644
in fact the blow was direct and severe	21.0625
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk  but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced  touch it not  grimaud he cried grimaud	49.9362
he must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial	41.6582
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect	46.8337
and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to  so much the better	20.6779
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task  and you will do right	27.4160
who are you cried selim	43.9041
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	75.9213
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	132.0694
chapter 2 father and son  we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dants who after having traversed la canebire took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the alles de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room	269.4573
you had your secret and we had ours we didnt exchange them	98.8855
where were we  i recollect you were saying said dartagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france	61.2198
i	21.9317
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off  hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you	36.1831
yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return  you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her  and what said the abb asked athos	163.4626
ho there my friend  the wounded man heaved a sigh	14.2754
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending	32.5117
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau asked the count are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodesin which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures  yes sir indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon  monte cristo shuddered antoine had been his jailer	145.1786
intact my dear friend besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine  but what is the use of harnesses without horses  i have an idea about them  athos you make me shudder  listen to me	37.9198
it is well as it is say no more about it  at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wifes secrets	25.2182
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but dartagnan confined himself to telling them that m de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused	65.9591
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also	66.2587
only we conspire against the rochellais  ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming  the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence	200.2307
if on the other side it was not shewhich was still quite possiblefor the little light that remained rendered a mistake easymight it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known	47.9852

his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsmercds had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude	86.1010
have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thingi mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to	28.7808
she bore me rapidly away	147.4097
as he entered the chamber of his friend dants cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view	15.9983
madame de villefort was dead	12.3357
it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly  athos took lord de winters hand and tried to turn the conversation	85.6410
he is walking about and thinking thought dartagnan but of what	101.6536
dartagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract	21.8473
order a larded hare a fat capon mutton leg dressed with garlic and four bottles of old burgundy  bazin who looked at his master without comprehending the cause of this change in a melancholy manner allowed the omelet to slip into the spinach and the spinach onto the floor	100.1876
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty	34.6435
as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinals time  athos waved his hand raoul bowed and dartagnan and planchet set out	39.2230
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	9.8194
i am a brute	25.2952
dartagnan appointed eight oclock at athoss residence	28.4130
he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercds	35.5204
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead	18.3474
i am well i want nothing do not call him  she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room	37.9168
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you	33.0860
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to  to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton	18.2506
and whose horses are these cried dartagnan	119.1815
well did there not happen an event which saved austria	59.3960
it was almost broad daylight	7.0878
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire	49.1814
his companions followed his example	73.7786
what next	598.2477
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes	52.9695
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	10.6727
dartagnan looked at porthos	30.8361
hes my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him	38.0148

charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected	19.6440
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life giving rays	225.5169
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled  yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it  albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice	157.2437

but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator  without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with  my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act  perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	106.0618

did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting  why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these dont make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others  at least you must admire morianis style and execution  i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a womans  my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please  the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way	90.1201

well asked he what now	82.6282
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dants knew that the mistral was blowing	31.8285
you are going to kill the son as you killed the mother	43.1039
she revives cried the young man	6.5230
and i have not seen him	9.7279

he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect	33.0503
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise	32.2802
then davrigny spoke	525.9360
it was useless to search at night and dants therefore delayed all investigation until the morning	27.6319

suppose we warn the masters  lets wait for grimaud  but perhaps they have killed him  grimaud would have cried out  you know he is almost dumb  we should have heard the blow then  but if he doesnt return  here he is  at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them	239.8330
he could not see it but he felt its presence	26.5184
no god forbid said the cardinal only at what hour was he with you  oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later  at what hour did he leave your htel  at half past tenan hour after the event  well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of trville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs  is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessarts company  yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected  that house is suspected trville said the king perhaps you did not know it  indeed sire i did not	106.5579
the point aimed at by every poniard	101.6902

the sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really haroun al raschids and giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours of idleness and ennui  by no means madame the fanciful exists no longer in the east	1499.4424
devil take me if ive ever been so happy as at this moment  and he wiped his eyes still moist	25.3710
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the htel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	53.2002
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future	37.8301
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	134.8025
they walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal march	73.6922
here is what you are looking for he said	16.7171
dants went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	21.3076
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my lifemy honor  ah	45.9682

thank god my child was not then dead  no it was not dead  and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy	46.5001

i havedoubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out  only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville  tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself  the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter	107.6762
both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance	6.8358
do you know that i am growing old	13.3356
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty  monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal	111.5123
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth	26.2785
but monsieur de trville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers  monseigneur is correctly informed said dartagnan	43.7674
if i were a frondeur said dartagnan i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper	28.6357
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others	55.0456
this desperate resistance could not last long	41.9039
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation	20.9656
well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot  that it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt  the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult	28.6552
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur	44.0812
they heard the guard going its rounds	158.3337
this fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul	179.3816
it is his son  dartagnans arm dropped to his side	41.2094
the jailer was right dants wanted but little of being utterly mad	47.4071
this manuvre was incomprehensible to dants	25.7580
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz	28.4399
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed we hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire	56.9136

go then animal said the duke but remember i only allow you half an hour  may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau my lord  yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family  la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment	137.5467
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison	75.7773
well will you take me or shall i take edward  madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue	39.0520

indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil geniuslike the wicked fairies in perraults stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptismhovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect  what a dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars	645.1316

we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward dartagnan	40.5595
the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordered with tombs	18.8915
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first	33.4291
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay	17.9078
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her	63.0254
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m de trvilles courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted	35.0048
he is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for yourself  by the way said the major you know i have only the 2000 francs which the abb busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and  and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m cavalcanti	82.4760
he pointed his finger to the lighted window	58.8024
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments qurens quem devoret	30.9321
i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs  yes almost said aramis	37.8736
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated  deaddead  50090m      chapter 103 maximilian  villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief	35.3035
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder	30.6269
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural	41.4150
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we are supposed not to know each other  you are right	42.1827
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance	13.8692
my dear m cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father  the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice  nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50000 francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent  the major looked anxiously around him	77.4432

yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology whom i sometimes consult about my studies  athos smiled	30.2297
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men  the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it	85.4956
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred	71.1452
without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them	65.1839
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again  sir said aramis you speak to the point	92.5735
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	31.2736
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the doorsteps m andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess	55.1099
and he had five millions in your hands alone	63.7054
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodire he arrived at m danglars door just at the same time that villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honor stopped to leave the baroness at her own house	46.6745
bear witness that we have done all that we could  that shall be testified to rest assured	15.3033
are you then making a thesis  without doubt replied the jesuit	19.1017
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father	65.6475
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind	43.0623
there was no further question therefore about marie michon among the four musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw mme	55.5679
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mre simons son who has not chosen the worst strawberries	12.1662
as happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am  well speak if it depends on me  oh sir	39.6413

do you know the decision we have come to mother  have we come to any  yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercds sighed	74.8769
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental dartagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance	63.6732
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	98.0047
my patron died	217.0533
ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible	12.1432
it is my will morrel	158.1635
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor  it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down	80.7687
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	28.4896
humph thought i that looks like my handiwork i fancy i must have mended that skull somewhere or other and in fact it was that unfortunate scotchman parrys brother you know on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength	36.4306

the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus	50.6679
the notes reminded the men that the children women and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons their wives and their fathers and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions	424.3510
what do you want sir asked the driver	12.7732
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend	39.2621
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms	22.8952
his words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more no embellishments no embroidery no arabesques	13.2051
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered	27.0301
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman	13.7464
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	54.4251

pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing  but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces  dont be afraid	35.4795
this was in fact a custom familiar to him	24.0746
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of chteau renaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	118.8124
behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door closed	36.1395
the concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830 he visited his own dungeon	31.0238
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	13.9351
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica	19.3356
i have warned m danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese	27.6881

the generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went	60.4264
monsieur dartagnan it cried	69.7319
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back	28.5051
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la ferei can see nothing remarkable about it  my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens	52.3405
m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character	54.6096
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber	23.3294
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	6.2209
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	21.7206
and you have a letter  yes there it is  give it to me then and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read	28.5577
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it  yes said danglars	52.7278
adieu mademoiselle	109.1221
perhaps so	135.3130
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken	19.1673
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around  i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground	77.6343
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket	27.8324
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes  in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it  poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet  well  well i must tell you	406.3840
winter approached	67.1309
for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the rue st denis or the faubourg st germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a caf on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julienand yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes	368.6117
bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the htel  each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general htel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey	50.0240
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey  monsieur darminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse	42.7109
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything  sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on  sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracya storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne	126.4222
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock	28.7873
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed  oh lucienoh my friend  the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgers name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife	124.3838
my only fear is that he will be too strong for you  my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish	21.4909
he then asked with whom he played	101.5333
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night	16.3694
the figure put the comb in its pocket	30.0890
well what have i learned since	44.9207
misfortune refreshes the memory	5.8760
bah it is now nearly healed and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain  what then said aramis blushing	20.3834
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother	40.5695
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other	28.8325
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead	41.5295
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	26.9603
but m de la trmouillealready prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know bernajoux wasreplied that it was neither for m de trville nor the musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose htel they had endeavored to burn	135.6337
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive	32.6217
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs	76.3518
you will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please with it i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition  i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency	44.0594
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay him  the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey	88.2882
he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destinyhe from whom death would have separated you calls you to him	26.7660
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal  lower	37.5364
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope  hope repeated danglars	18.8643
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard	20.8683
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m de nargonne had married m danglars	33.7734
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart	53.5444
well said dartagnan	5.7263
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again  athos put his arm around aramiss neck and embraced him	28.7201
suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pele mele the intrenchments with the fugitives	7.0087
i married exclaimed monte cristo shuddering who could have told you so  no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman  she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince	107.6656
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor	43.2911
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	20.4436
at this moment the door of the ministers box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	15.2820
three quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him	25.5351
she lived in the place royalethen the fashionable quarterat number 6 and he undertook to call and take dartagnan with him in order to introduce him	25.9148
poor young creature	78.6967
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort  why not  becausei scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it  is it so	86.8067
leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied  my dear albert said franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see litalienne  alger  agreed returned albert but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for  the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes	114.7804
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head  the devil	22.2241
1f3	66.4314
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours  which you please monsieur said the light horseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven  thirty five minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you  and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	65.0252
what	16.6170
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back a step or two but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place	105.3725
i was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness	96.1901
yes his mother  but does he know this secret then  i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession  unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope  i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges  thus speaking he fell back exhausted	140.2452
happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness danglars is happy  and fernand  fernand	154.6344
well said dartagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death  athos shook his head	27.6743
stop	83.2773
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentines room perhaps she has emptied them  ask her said morrel translating noirtiers thought this time by his look	29.0253
no still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man	36.5992
milady clarik received dartagnan ceremoniously	25.7948
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service  thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business  madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais  that is all i wished to know said the queen	40.8279
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat	25.2862
and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable  i quite understand why you ask sir said eugnie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation	226.7936
de chteau renaud exaggerates  not worth speaking of cried chteau renaud life is not worth speaking ofthat is rather too philosophical on my word morrel	37.8393
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance	39.7582
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort	14.0461
he was alone again	56.4773
but its all my fault yes its all my fault because it is myself who selects my men	40.3366
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead	21.6024
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory  yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	38.8675
he cannot pardon her the history of the saraband	42.1178
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	59.2857
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	6.7320
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of	62.8219
oh save me  a pen a pen said the doctor	57.0830
oh	13.9066
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning	22.9732
sell cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left	25.6112
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me	33.6535
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened	156.5056
porthos bowed	98.9490
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the conversation	44.2125
the rest of mademoiselle eugnies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of diana as chteau renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute	54.4900
as for myself as soon as i recovered my senses i went to monsieur the governor to whom i related all that had passed and asked what i should do with my prisoner	52.1975
at this instant m de trville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	10.2422
before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there	47.1535
never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers neck	27.0369
thank you  no sir neither of those something connected with this story  really	60.8695
he was an italian and therefore superstitious	20.1773
ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant i believe you are impudent to me	18.9581
once under my grandfathers roof m morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case i shall expect m morrel to come and claim me at my own hands	164.7420
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress	26.2870
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied dartagnan and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account	34.2122
but they are calling me	56.3701
get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men  a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	36.7893
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu	35.2300
no no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone  the honorable the kings attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dants mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris	56.5272
then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a sigh	15.2580
you have ill understood wrongly interpreted i did not mean to say  silence silence cried the duke	28.6882
your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired	37.1980
he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort	15.4211
in heavens name my dear athos do not make a useless sacrifice	22.1553
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms	12.5661
the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic	34.2314
what m morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us  no no said m morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away but i have no more ships and therefore i do not want any sailors  no more ships returned penelon well then youll build some well wait for you  i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i cannot accept your kind offer  no more money	39.4069
mademoiselle eugnie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle darmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer  since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events	184.8505
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon	12.1873
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	27.9320
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	152.2099
but stop	786.0855
they were his friends and not mine	53.8238
good evening m de morcerf  the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality	24.9991
speak	69.0286
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done	26.8491
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead  m	18.7237
pass on your way then it is the best thing to do  this raillery exasperated jussac	15.1693
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth  these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	52.8030
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh     offense	47.7417
i shall always love you be sure of that	34.5406
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb	69.3256
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him	47.4292
m albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like eugnie sufficiently	61.6119
i dont know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord  was the woman handsome  young and beautiful	28.5439
and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhne from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description	400.1128
immediately m de trville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	22.1695
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages  yes no doubt but improved upon by ours	14.9127
to what country demanded porthos	82.3454
i cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me	52.9098
is it thus you perform your charge monsieur continued the king without directly replying to de trvilles question	37.1986
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open	15.8527
a brute that cardinal	61.4845
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone	64.5920
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination	58.4492
did she stay long there  an hour and a half  did she return home  directly  well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy  bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening	213.7613
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty  and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abb busoni  it was your excellency the benevolent abb took an evident interest in all that concerned me	87.9353
fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god	19.7494
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what oclock it was he was shown monsieur de chavignys watch it was then half past six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised	126.9559
do not open the pie till you are alone	63.5462
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head	113.2424
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin  athos shook his dead doubtfully	33.4240
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left dartagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything	26.0893
permesso inquired he	3.1762
oh yes she said i saw but i cannot believe  would you rather die then and cause maximilians death  oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the housecan i not escape  valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape	108.0407
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	45.8640
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say	14.7857
whose then is the air we breathe	125.3857
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it	74.7833
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	30.0607
and now go mordaunt  before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir  a favor from me  mordaunt bowed	51.8787
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead  do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance  so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again	77.5366
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account  you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man	43.2738
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have them  a horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my friend  ah madame said porthos haughtily do you take me for a beggar  no i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton  well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules	72.2694
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve  oh	28.4981
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery	72.9085
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it  bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	89.9429
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition  he had just completed this monologuewhich proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologuewhen the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out  ah	80.8318
he no longer feared realities but phantoms	13.8232
to arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind	29.1878
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed	34.2998
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dants and myself each to resume our respective posts  thanks danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties	49.3783
where am i exclaimed she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm  madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings  my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady	153.3928
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience  but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does  oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god	104.1094
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow	90.3028
and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him	102.5439
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman  the punishment of death replied lord de winter	23.6340
1e8	96.7572
my dear dartagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn  my faith said dartagnan with great pleasure	55.5958
this pretended dartagnanwas he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into trvilles house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances	148.7796
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment  how you are going soon asked milady	63.9117
gimblou a glass of wine  well how has all gone off  zounds	48.4704
well here we are at last said one of them	28.8107
she must have spoken she must have confessed everythinga woman is so weak	22.6862
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	69.4675
however im glad not to fight them until to morrow	29.3716
the misfortune is great but i think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercels  and not a man to instruct them	11.8923
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole	39.5844
open the gate he cried	41.8409
but you first came to breakfast did you not	57.4674
albert returned safelythen the count was revenged	17.5944
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door	20.6642
you too have been in england sir he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order	24.1419
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy  andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began	36.8379
the 5000000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand	22.3232
singular man muttered gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door	42.9402
m de trville never jested in matters relating to discipline	10.4198
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose	28.1059
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness  but your eminence replied the prince	48.5783
on his side dartagnan became more cautious also	18.3079
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly	34.8313
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her	15.7278
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur	30.9090
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose	36.1827
dartagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features	23.9518
will you not even say you will see me again he asked	33.7174

valentine repeated the same voice	18.7658
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner  the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken	74.4887

the heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival	37.2131
in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress	25.6950

athos porthos and aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much pleased	118.4660
at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i will or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man  it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert	67.3764
i live retired in the house of my noble protector but i do it from choice	54.7531

you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant  yes  well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot  so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you  certainly	157.8904
it is only the dead who do not return  you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which dartagnan alone understood	27.2651
in ten minutes the masters slept not so the servants hungry and more thirsty than hungry	25.7892
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside	41.5996
no replied athos with a singular smile	13.5687
fine sport  are you still bent on departure athos asked dartagnan	50.0950
now the mischief is out depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dants hidden treasures  mercds however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers arrest	91.3109

it isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table	38.5909
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general	10.8390
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the cardinal	34.2432

he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth	19.3887
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statueyielding light without warmth	175.0160
what	66.0730
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	81.8854
the wife of athos   we have now to search for athos said dartagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue	77.4979
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones  oh mon dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king  oh yes said de winter for they are the same men	45.7796
50025m    but at least you will be there  will all paris be there  oh certainly  well like all paris i shall be there too said the count	59.8949
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her	15.8886
then steer for monte cristo  the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island	38.1781
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	39.5244
gentlemen said he m	18.3136
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle	29.3485
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	62.0547
to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service  a great servicewhat was that  why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor  what	48.6830
i have been here since the morning	18.9867
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did  add to that dartagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him  he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth  and here we are at the ninth	97.0987
the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count i accept the count returned to young morcerf	42.0475
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of henrietta maria	31.2710
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties  it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers  you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort	43.3904
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of oak	41.7352
he approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and dartagnan could get no hold	34.7876
who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed	64.0076
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter	29.0313
the two witnesses followed	24.4447
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	27.2217
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere  very good thought dartagnan tis our road likewise we will go together  all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones	67.4362
well be it so at length said eugnie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch  here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is	77.4562
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us  but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly  aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house  this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know	66.2189
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all  oh cried the executioner all	26.0375
by notre dame	16.8665
porthos smiled	237.6982
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	43.0127
why you told me he was a young man	19.6791
it matters little	81.7716
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	13.2314
i have not seen such a one four times in my life	34.3978
it was this gentleman said dartagnan bowing to the officer	20.8999
what do you require then  i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france  but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke  she is found said milady	53.9709
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husbands father  yes madame m de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis i think  alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	74.2366
unhappily those times are past  nonsense	48.5612
he was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols	26.1922
we must not do so  no  you do not sanction our project  no  there is another way said morrel	28.3132
to be decapitated	78.4823

indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world dartagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress	30.7927
he was not however a good sleeper	32.7535
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly dartagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	191.0209

gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m de monte cristo and myself  possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	45.5724
madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing room  a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it  some grand personagea prince i believe they saidthe count of monte cristo  i will come directly cried valentine aloud	121.1971

you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box	20.4389
deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde	31.2010
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl	17.4072
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentines mind	11.1967
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the sofa	12.8847
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses	24.0963
excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace  accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him	133.2179
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	74.8780
dartagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends	97.9567
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel	12.2515
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealththat first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man	21.6529
will your majesty deign to excuse me  speak sir speak boldly replied louis	37.4239
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge in two words dartagnan informed him where mme	29.1409
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercds as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	383.9310
i take charge of everything be easy  it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sister in law  and me said athos she is my wife  dartagnan smiledfor he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret	66.9114
thank you parry  when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	38.5434
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry	25.2370
ifaith no said dartagnan i was not in voice monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either	41.0368
it is excellent advice	84.4643
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them  and you were wrong madame	27.1845
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day i presume  that is the night my lord i answered	39.7764
you seek me sir said he	29.4260
now as they had already traveled eleven leagues dartagnan thought it time to stop whether porthos were or were not in the inn	59.9782
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them	29.3071
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	29.1987
dream of vengeance  chapter xxxvii	19.4133
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish	28.3152
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts	32.5935
and then said monte cristo this is not all  what is there more said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars	25.1931
still though not actually received at the htel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess	76.2036
free to leave me  leave you	37.1885
my dear planchet said dartagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me	44.2770
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath	26.5983
such a thing is really out of ruleeccentric or stupid	13.7032
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right  rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued	74.6584
the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirty five	59.8968
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us  morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god	140.7403
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	31.9291
chapter lxxv	128.0358
decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young mans hand	10.4949
davrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead	27.7945
hold continued dartagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn  yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins	49.2058
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this	63.1958
etiquette had no minuti unknown to him	8.0390
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off  where do we sleep colonel  at thirsk replied harrison	22.9672
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father	50.4899
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you  athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior	42.1144
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect	47.3184
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	14.6478
i am replied the latter gravely	31.4455
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand	36.6239
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them	22.8762
yes sir replied the abb and you are the person whom m de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police  exactly sir  one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris  yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	43.7799
alberts attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed	88.9461
where are your passports  we have none we left england ignorant of the state of politics here having left paris before the departure of the king  ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are mazarinists who are sent as spies  my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport	90.8353
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile	26.0595
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	33.1109
you jest said she in a hollow voice	33.7140
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman	32.3714
danglars asked for a knife and fork	42.6155
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinencewhile on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have donedartagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained for as to the letter addressed to m de trville it had disappeared	132.6240
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please  then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated  franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile	71.1527
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances	13.7740
i see you now	34.2259
as he had seen milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving england he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond studs	41.6280
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his sidenot from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times	189.5587
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	83.3031
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner	229.3544
whereupon grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	7.9740
one might believe the queen was about to speak	20.2526
there only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled	36.7654
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar	36.4173
he called for dartagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him dartagnan not being on service	54.2328
where stammered morcerf	80.2941
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word  i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons	149.4299
hold sire said dartagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king  the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute	98.0794
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests	65.6474
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family  monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery	80.9363
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the caf de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted	104.0928
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	15.4061
that your mother and m de villefort are both coming to this dinner	48.5437
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith	31.3915
undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow  what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	110.9672
you are too charming said dartagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love  no i use your generosity thats all	41.9201
what has just happened  yes said the count you are rightit is miraculous  for albert is brave resumed morrel	29.7953
yes and thats all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail	38.3256
was born	714.5891
porthos cried athos and laughed aloud	32.2977
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	31.9307
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all  my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons	26.2351
  luigi vampa  what think you of that inquired franz	71.2481
so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly	36.6785
mr	42.4845
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo	45.6232
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia	47.5566
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolenceswhich even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastropheswere seen to be utterly futile	60.6185
suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	19.0001
no i dont want your help watch the cardinal  i am watching said porthos	45.6765
mother he said turning towards mercds this is m debray secretary of the minister for the interior once a friend of mine  how once stammered debray what do you mean  i say so m debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any	109.2444
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name	17.3817
but were you not on horseback	63.2352
i am determined to tell them all about it  be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety	25.3160
for the king cried dartagnan	16.4293
will you allow me father said carmela	54.3753
edward endured the accident with miraculous couragehe did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over	45.7560
what does it signify to you if i am murdered	14.7349
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek  yes such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball  was he not a fine looking man  yes  of lofty stature  yes  of pale complexion and brown hair  yes yes that is he how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man	105.0024
skirmishing	38.0962
there was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	15.6455
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have said to you to this man or i am lost and it would be youyou  then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to feltons mouth	40.8105
m de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france	13.7013
the four old friends prepare to meet again	11.1189
we will send my brothers servant back to bthune whom as i told you we can trust	36.6948
those idiots cried porthos they have not even pursued us	21.2961
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke	35.6522
1e6	30.0290
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	523.1889
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all  the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort	37.5093
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted  haydes arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands	96.2183
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	34.1175
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped	33.1660
the pavilion  chapter xxv	34.4931
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	63.3768
another possessed all mercds heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead	111.7353
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience i see an abb cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be aramis  it was indeed aramis	16.6506
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness	20.5190
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances	47.9977
i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy  you are a brave youth dartagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature	45.1280
except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career grard de villefort was as happy as a man could be	40.7692
then dartagnan became almost wild	39.2569
at that moment he cut it	39.6077
i swear to you i protest  oh but god is above	51.5697
athos smiled the smile was melancholy	117.3712
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table	24.8731
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much	13.9225
there you must rest young people are such braggarts  it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds	55.6151
and why revenge he asked	93.3419
where are you going asked dants	12.1511
of aramis yes since he has become an abb	56.8399
teresa had a great desire to see this ball	22.0929
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed	16.9526
as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	18.3968
a man  the discussion is going to begin again said mme	67.8277
there were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated	16.7602
be one or the other but not both replied porthos	65.8805
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction	16.5397
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance  do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london  the devil	60.6608
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	24.1841
of the evil you have done said the voice	36.2065
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you	39.5122
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairson the expulsion of don carlos	9.3573
i shall retire and die tranquillyat home  for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron  you shall be one  and have you not seen any of our other friends  yes i have seen aramis  and what does he wish	95.2779
finally dartagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne	39.6448
we are going according to all probability to la rochelle and once gone  she will follow you to the end of the world athos if she recognizes you	44.2302
your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon youbeware  athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile	84.4351
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathit does not come alone listen	34.8362
we have accomplished more difficult things than that	49.5490
you must be aware that i was ignorant of that madame  what is that stupid fellow troubling himself about cried the cavalier whom milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach window	22.8621
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him	23.7243
athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the air	21.1230
if i stay in paris i cannot go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur dartagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron  true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneurs resignation  i am to remain minister then said mazarin	72.0717
why should you meddle with what does not concern you  the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation	39.1112
i tell you what m franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now  and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert  well then hearken to me  i listen  you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question  i do  neither can we procure horses  true we have offered any sum but have failed  well now what do you say to a cart	203.8835
thin and lanky  the executioner said dartagnan and aramis at the same time	8.7753
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief  here i am said vampa instantly appearing what do you want  take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here i ask no more for libertyi only ask to live  then you suffer a great deal  oh yes yes cruelly  still there have been men who suffered more than you  i do not think so  yes those who have died of hunger  danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed	440.7192
help cried he	8.4993
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees	26.4737
it remains now for us to keep our word	61.6115
what is it said monte cristo	5.5451
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw  dear child said mercds endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye	63.1858
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to gain  and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion  well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil that of bracieux in the soissonais and that of pierrefonds in the valois	161.1609
have a care cried porthos to his opponent ive still two pistols charged  the more reason you should fire the first cried his foe	58.4912
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum	347.1830
dartagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal	35.9889
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream	66.1133
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	23.4984
the duc dorlans visited the posts	23.2781
an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury	26.6687
to the installation of my rival at m danglars  what rival  ma foi what rival	25.2217
the countess took albert to meet madame danglars	76.2282

im surprised you have never so much as asked after him	40.3207
and you want my blessing he said	44.9627
no you are at your journeys end  how monsieur	37.9839
the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilitys boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants	92.7888
night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark	110.6889
put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with  consider all this done	55.3786
excellent there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux  suppose we ask these englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest blaisois	41.1551
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped  but athos cried dartagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he  as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty	70.1491
give me the despatch raoul  the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct	21.5550
he has slain his uncle he murmured	30.9934
through or over coachman gallop on  the coachman raised his whip	26.1617
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	182.0673
may i at least return asked morrel	126.4019
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	82.8104
the fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen	15.6062
ah my poor friends murmured dartagnan where are you	17.6217
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	41.8619
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avr cessato di vivere	1.0077
for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse	37.0986
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner  amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us  but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	112.9717
chapter viii	158.8676
this evening said the governor	22.0372
his first remark on entering was  you know sir i do not speak french  i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	60.2092
i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it	40.9956
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his highnesss pieces of water i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds	40.7149
go to your father go and see mercds and afterwards come to me  shall i row you ashore  no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars	43.3581
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating dartagnan by a look	21.1375
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	47.8027

their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on alberts account ceased instantly	54.0012
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out	11.6312
it was one of the results of mazarins niggardliness	10.0426
besides he is an englishman	21.2302

it was porthos	44.4396
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did  why so inquired dants	53.5130
all falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face	84.8484
on the morrow he received the last touches of mousquetons brush for an hour and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune	25.5183

he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majestys letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it  the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly	102.0638
i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave	20.8671
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title	29.1382
dants was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend	21.6638
it will be even more difficult to descend  dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	45.1832
who calls me  i said mazarin with his most smiling expression	43.1377
no doubt you come to join the princes  as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud	56.2210
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed	34.0543
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events	23.4109
dartagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself  they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras their friends must have done before them	96.6307
it is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to hither	18.1092

what is it you want dear grandpapa said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud thenfinding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant noshe said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to another  she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted	39.7760
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone  yes said dartagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison him  good god	40.7294
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat	34.4327
the bandits laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings	95.3369
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that dartagnans adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fighta part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons	542.6430
in whose name do you come said he to him	35.3737
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he	73.0140
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other	24.9342

whose is that letter of your mistress	118.7434
there was no longer any doubt the treasure was thereno one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket	14.8568
athos as a diplomatist	38.6704
june and july were the terrible months with athos	31.7111
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	27.8610
it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard said he	38.8320
he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at 4000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at 8000 crowns	21.8945
i feel cramps over my whole body  do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes  yes  any noise in the ears  frightful  40112m    when did you first feel that  just now  suddenly  yes like a clap of thunder  did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before  nothing  no drowsiness  none  what have you eaten today  i have eaten nothing i only drank a glass of my masters lemonadethats all and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him	1289.0487
i will call for them  today  no tomorrow i shall not have time today  well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil  may i depend on it  certainly  because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it  now see here will that be all	75.2781

albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow	13.0408

not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of france  dartagnan breathed again	32.9188
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders	29.9457

oliver cromwell  very well monsieur mordaunt said mazarin give me this second letter and sit down  the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat	35.9009
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as dartagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris	37.7998
chapter xxvii	104.6636
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber	24.6675
the king wishes to get a sleep  one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone	51.3225
oh	85.8832
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years	28.7937
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh  ah ah said the cardinal and you monsieur porthos  i monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibitedi seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken  very well said the cardinal and you monsieur aramis  monseigneur being of a very mild disposition and being likewise of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders i endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword treacherously across my left arm	149.1155
dartagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men	18.8860
aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer but iwhat have i in the world	22.9256
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues	30.0878
it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age	29.3490
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god	66.7199
poor fellow	9.2152
good evening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay  yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars	42.9609
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now  get down then and quickly  grimaud leaped down	67.2343
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear	25.2007
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message	31.6555
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god  i will go said the monk	49.9752
he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antechamber	84.6365
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of cross examination  which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin	50.5375
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends	109.7204
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	32.9965
in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted man to make a journey to london for her	50.0378
if i were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do	33.3576
toward six oclock dartagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night	23.9254
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand	38.6951
meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her intended	35.9430
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wifediable  and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse  yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true	22.0177
unfortunately no	35.1351
answer me do not these crimes exist  yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated  ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance	61.2588
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord  faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling	51.0583
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it  go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety	56.7503
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him	20.3001
begone then to your beautiful duchess i will detain you no longer  and she is not to be despised in my opinion  now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last	41.6860
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	40.2515
do you wish me to lend you some  30253m    what a bad calculator you are exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation	16.8597
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever	21.0149
those two words your mass and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips  i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer i sir	90.1885
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today	65.4163
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement	40.4893
why this woman was a monster	31.0680
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me  i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly	16.9730
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning	43.4217
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugnie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	51.5980
what does this mean demanded he of the cardinal	15.2240
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall	20.4302
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual	41.4376
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino	23.7672
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andreas attentions in order to get rid of morcerf but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him	36.0906
oh beautiful life	329.6685
debray muttered albert	39.1247
well am i to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying my father my father like monsieur pixrcourt27  do not let us jest gravely replied bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it  bah said andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of bertuccios manner why not  because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you  oh these are fine words  and there will be fine doings if you do not take care  menacesi do not fear them	88.0823
he wouldnt listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird	84.6191
yes replied the old man	6.6391
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and dartagnan and advanced toward the door	21.9261
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his headif anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three daysif anyone had said to either of us then livethe day will come when you will be happy and will bless lifeno matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulityand yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing youhow often have i myself  ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine  look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasivelook at me	82.9000
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	36.2155
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk	18.2112
gentlemen said dartagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six  besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity	27.0743
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her dont try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv  when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis	173.4292
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungryvery hungry  and your excellency wants something to eat  at once if possible  nothing easier said peppino	16.4261
onward cried dartagnan in a loud voice	6.1211
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love	15.8888
such felicity seems above all priceas a thing impossible and unattainable	8.8451
he will come in here and m morrel had better godo you not think so grandpapa  yes signed the old man	24.8702
never  sire i entreat you to do so  besides in what manner can i make advances first  by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her  what is that  give a ball you know how much the queen loves dancing	59.5379
enchanted monsieur said mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the queen  it will not be so difficult replied dartagnan springing to the ground	32.4096
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her	23.7045
very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion	81.3865
you ask that  put your two hands together	71.1045
grimaud moved as if to leave the room	28.5252
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself demolished	31.6330
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	50.0084
i send them but like pilatewashing my hands  and what does mademoiselle darmilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil  oh well i dont know but i understand that she is going to italy	71.6209
then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen	28.6932
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	43.2332
la ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince	32.5190
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god	75.6287
aramis cried athos i am arrested  good replied aramis calmly	38.9257
two angelic faces	7.2174
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him	22.8901
the guards were unable to help any oneeach one was occupied with his self preservation	21.3916
you will do for me what you have done for the queen  certainly dartagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out	25.4697
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur bonacieux	25.2687
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris	17.7668
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan	44.8203
a capital blow you gave cried porthos	107.8687
charles perceived it and took his hand	34.6932
yes i am the executioner of lille and this is my history  all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention	25.7315
sit down there and eat in security	33.6050
he hurt my shoulder	178.8833
my god	23.5339
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles  that was no reason for staking my diamond replied dartagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm	38.7962
nay it must have been a promise  a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh  let them answered dartagnan	35.2234
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence	55.1204
it was very hard  the horse said morcerf laughing	57.6991
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven	26.1429
the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of pre lachaise where m de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family	17.4007
i mean to ask if you are married  ah	34.6180
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of dartagnan cruelly mystified him	25.1065
here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building	28.9144

i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages	20.1979
of that which i am ready to feel toward you  and what is that proof  are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress  oh yes said kitty clapping her hands very willing  well then come here my dear said dartagnan establishing himself in an easy chair come and let me tell you that you are the prettiest soubrette i ever saw  and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who asked nothing better than to believe him did believe him	70.3788
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy  you madame said dartagnan affecting surprise is that possible my godgood and beautiful as you are  a mortal enemy  indeed  an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death	64.2817
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there  athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven	26.6779

the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life  no no cried dants you are mistakenyou will not die	51.1754
felton give me that knife  and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom	82.1814
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his friendship  mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man  i said mercds blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever	100.6767
the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deep set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads	89.7135
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated	61.1858
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitors emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone	82.0611
the case had been provided for if marie michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayer book bound in green velvet  that is true monsieur you are well informed  one morning the green book was brought to her by the prince de marsillac	153.5675

this petition to napoleon kept back by villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings attorney	72.1626
but dartagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friends valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five	43.0410
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was	85.0491

this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left	112.2672

his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea	47.1601
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	62.7498
morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me  no count but to leave paris  if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there  valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time  maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them	86.9458
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder  yes certainly  well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire	153.6948

and with his lackey he took the road to the governors country house	18.4462
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo	42.4566
but what do you think of the music  what music  why the music you have been listening to  oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes  from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise  30097m    you are right in some degree when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep  then sleep here my dear count	127.9093
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture	11.8050
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest	164.1083
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy	21.6742
the expulsion took place and i pocketed 600000 francs the day charles v repassed the bidassoa	11.8444
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before  ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortunes  it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people	152.4953
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	56.8438
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the htel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gata as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended	139.8342
a terrible vision   the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment	19.4652
ah sir said dartagnan you have a wicked smile	9.9805

my god i am dying  and the duke swooned	20.9527
remember your oath	170.1254
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal	18.5958
will this promise be fulfilled m noirtier asked morrel while davrigny looked inquiringly	44.9190
yes you	26.8952
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned	26.9076
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation	47.7951
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right	19.3672
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world  you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them  really said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment	28.9044
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do	43.8247
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris	77.0867
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber	25.5794
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain  i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood	40.9371
1b	30.5749
yes you were thinking of it and with justice	44.0246
the chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it	26.2541
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it	25.9395
everyone offered his own	12.0867
you know something of that as well as i do i think	18.6047
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring emmanuel	22.6909
thou seest simpleton said dartagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us  but to whom then  ifaith	33.2591
dartagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	26.3239
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved  everything shall be done as you say athos	30.2138
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney	59.5281
oh	23.0131
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief	46.5985
hes well guarded now we only said he would escape  who said so  repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale	116.8951
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but i conjure you do not abandon me	26.4916
monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends	24.5601
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	18.3084
mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key  bravo said aramis how did you manage it  like everything else with money but it cost me dear  how much asked athos	37.9619
can we do anything for you asked athos	18.1587
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint mran arose from her pillow	23.6345
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued dartagnan with his frank expression	15.7755
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance	44.2338
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	45.0092
but dartagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	15.5104
hey	39.4819
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	8.0462
besides the woman wore that black mantle which dartagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer	49.9526
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years	44.2583
but the moment is come to keep your word i have reached my destination  and you will have nothing to fear on your return  i shall have nothing to fear but robbers  and that is nothing  what could they take from me	34.2703
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25000  and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked monte cristo	85.6632
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm	29.2929
now said the baron look at this woman	29.3925
now as dartagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced himself	55.8285
oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much	34.9714
you will be a brave and adventurous captain  dartagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp	56.4475
madame danglars is ill said villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage  oh mon dieu said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle  i have mine said madame de villefort and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward	29.9988
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me  no not if thou dost not oppose my flight  but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man  i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place  you are determined to leave the chateau  by heaven and earth	33.1016
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly  however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you  yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	347.5710
stop said he i have an idea  well thats something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly but as to dartagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses	40.8843
i have devoted myself to industry i study the useful arts	54.2716
eh give it to me said the young man	12.7024
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he did	24.9172
what more do you want and she fell full length on the floor	36.2682
i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching	45.5793
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep	23.7664
and a comforting one too added dartagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man	29.4084
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human	43.0392
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry	28.7668
30301m    meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him	51.1745
you can sleep here  yes do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you  no i must sleep at beaucaire	55.3138
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek	15.6139
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk  grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	28.9514
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	42.1410
yes count returned the notary	74.2636
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm	21.0195
you lie it cried	107.7942
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces	33.2825
how can i understand	12.5354
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect   your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers   thats all well cried dartagnan	22.5200
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge	20.3856
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition  and villeforts father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called	22.8123
grimaud entered	127.0450
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell  but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos	56.4853
as for m danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	31.9180
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming  i follow you  20111m    cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlinis part	43.0627
the day after to morrow is a holiday  yes my lordpentecost  will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow  in what  in gastronomy  willingly my lord  but tete a tete	26.8455
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers  athos smiled	52.0750
besides what was morcerf seeking	146.4743
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown	13.6717
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for dartagnan	47.3460
hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines  on	24.9967
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless	35.5437
a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity	5.6462
forward blaisois  a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank	207.7404
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm	22.5965
m dartagnan it is for you to accuse her first  dartagnan advanced	64.1516
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp	53.0135
they went out	29.1525
i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do  but who then was this man asked felton	20.9746
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself	25.5272
on my honor in one single throw  but having lost the horses i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses  stake your diamond then  this	46.0456
from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years	40.5722
then taking a passport from his drawer he saidgood it is available for two months longer     chapter 105 the cemetery of pre lachaise  m de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth	67.9538
it was only a way of speaking	33.8968
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word	28.0468
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	68.1675
eight thousand crowns amounted to 48000 livres he would then have about 5050000 francs left	13.7953
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion	57.7491
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways  you will take your musketoon and your pistols  there now	18.5435
no replied noirtier eagerly	58.7374
my first visit was to the thicket	56.1381
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which i consider quite beneath me	42.7390
pray reflect a little	32.5267
presently	32.0857
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move	45.6601
never fear quarrels but seek adventures	22.9386
his first cry was for his father but that father was dead  my father too is dead said morrel	52.9931
by men of heart i mean men of courage	196.8390
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square headed nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another	28.6163
are you prepared  yes sir  you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage	33.6463
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	73.6323
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de trville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my htel	21.4588
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith	34.3763
why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party	80.9514
now am i at liberty to retire said the general	29.0564
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	3.1852
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains	426.2504
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you	23.8846
speak not of it reverend sir	60.9712
do you agree with aramis  not at all said dartagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion  what	44.8600
dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviiis throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire	30.8896
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given	228.4637
the opinion of athos was that dartagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish	35.5832
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	48.1358
milady sprang toward him	22.7823
well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	92.9280
you have an excellent memory milady  but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france  the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness	93.9143
then a singular thing occurred	36.8719
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master	28.3803
was it an entire army	50.7432
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed	14.3560
one would think we had tipped the wink  what could i do said porthos	22.0278
come take a little oath for me on the cross i wont ask anything more of you  on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth	67.5258
arras was encumbered with fugitives	4.5300
at the rospoli palace  the count had three windows at the rospoli palace  yes	15.4331
come laporte said the queen	22.5231
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married her	31.6640
he consequently sprang up again re entered the office with a turn of his finger set the clock right again that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street	188.5371
yes said albert blushing	50.9440
he made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk	37.3037
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	33.1203
the door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to all	46.5928
the initials are only minec	20.9529
and how did he treat you  with more of mildness than severity  did you tell him your whole story  i did  and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination  he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape	75.6267
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	78.9493
you are ungrateful dartagnan said athos yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner	41.0364
i missed her by twenty minutes at st omer	61.9431
i not only permit i desire let them come in  the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	49.1164
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven	30.0603
what will our two friends say	89.4267
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable  and do you not remember the frenchmans name said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator	41.3162
twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth	17.9984
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers	47.0780
i leave you therefore as i took yourich but little respected	25.5119
do not fly then	34.3689
porthos was the first who came to himself	24.9312
he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes	57.5083
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab  and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison  certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed  yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it  oh very easily	393.1434
it is a little worse for the journey but thats no matter  there are no horses  albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	54.2344
chapter 106 dividing the proceeds  the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prs where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person	53.1908
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound	10.3959
dartagnan let me confess to you what ive been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes  speak out answered dartagnan	130.6978
did not you know that my dear lord  something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me	33.9409
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me  and you say you will wait for me at armentires  at armentires  write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it	33.9304
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is  alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again	33.0109
wait for me here all of you cried m morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on  thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can  this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind	125.7445
after a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of adolescence	34.3256
yes madame  well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes  i am sorry to say i cannot replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert  are you very anxious to know countess asked albert	467.3989
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him	16.0737
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to dartagnans face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king	53.6350
mercds looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch	13.2107
chapter xxxiv	53.4618
from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window  adieu dear friend  oh i cant let you go so	49.7442
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation	23.0649
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death  yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned  another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket	48.7158
these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the comte de la fere	13.5733
do you talk of your honor	21.7312
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight  no noby no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground	51.5478
i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him	16.1914

planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of paris and to march on charenton when necessary	134.7157

0285m    evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck	174.2955
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england  she was young you say  twenty five years old  beautiful  ravishingly  blond  yes  abundance of hairfalling over her shoulders  yes  eyes of an admirable expression  when she chose	121.5845

i am acquainted with it before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment  a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined  dartagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance  dartagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs	110.0451
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before meby and by will do for that  with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home	43.5533
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	21.7754
do you think he would recollect you  my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me  well go and talk with the boy said dartagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead  planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible while dartagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts	80.9913
she then thought that lord de winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer	51.0903
the count withdrew his foot	29.6005
doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you  my dear m de villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity	36.9326

what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel	21.9113
i shall replied dartagnan and instantly  in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascons hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it and athos bowed to dartagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts	102.2640
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me	86.2225
stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of terror	25.1624
yes that is my name  you said then by the word of bonacieux	42.5909
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general  and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard  no to be sure replied dartagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him  groslows face brightened	62.5816
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor	9.1228
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish	24.6603
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are  a fallen prince exclaimed mazarin piteously	25.4087
what is it cried many persons present	61.4280
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be  the answer was so little like the one mercds desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan	86.2541
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful  the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	44.6981
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress	29.6349
queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these  and m de beaufortis he still in prison  yes	25.1010
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age	51.6077
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	14.1341
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers	25.1591
this is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair	38.5997
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one	75.1802
i have this said he	40.9664
i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related	61.6469
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant	27.8372
50123m    yes i think i saw him pass but pray call emmanuel  excuse me madame but i must go up to maximilians room this instant replied monte cristo i have something of the greatest importance to tell him  go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared	86.9276
what is there astonishing in that  and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me  no  so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel  for you alone  the deuce	70.4680
ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret	24.2568
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands	15.2547
and you  hang it said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with you i must go away with you	39.5561
he has come thought milady	153.1310
and this explains how dartagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la chevrette	15.6954
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugnie and the arrest of benedettovillefort having retired as well as noirtier and davrignyher thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard	34.9051
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye	14.4341
i only wait till you give them  you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen  will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made  yes for i have the proofs  i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation  without doubt	50.5769
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed	20.2539
oh he exclaimed i begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves i shall make the round of the boat  as for me said porthos i will see to the supper  a very good idea porthos said the gascon	54.1885
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue	27.7132
when the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experienceit became necessary i say to come to the conclusion of the affair that is to say to search the queen herself	70.4019
if i may ask without indiscretion  near here replied de comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are  he is wandering about the environs of the castle thought dartagnan	537.6976
and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man	73.2245
bayonne  yes the road to bayonne  and afterwards the road to chtillon  yes  by the tower of montlhry you mean  yes  thank you	18.3125
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her  i cried buckingham	40.9314
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another	38.9027
i believe i see double	117.6672
write my lord he said	15.2532
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge	9.5106
he used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat	34.2612
au revoir benedetto and running into a court he disappeared	25.8359
i cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king	32.3078
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	41.9928
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive	16.1742
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all	14.9280
noirtier closed his right eye	45.5775
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousses glass and do not interfere with us  yes yes dants good health said caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health	55.5839
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag	35.7137
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	41.0289
the next morning king charles i was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	25.7195
the stranger was about to reply but at the moment he opened his mouth dartagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the door	27.5334
it was quite dark and no one saw them go out	46.6931
at the same time monte cristos voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power  more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs lyses	25.7912
that would be a far better life than i lead now but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch who wont dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor  on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house	165.8106
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dants with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones	49.9333
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty	33.1115
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there  who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	123.4565
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwells permission	28.4206
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched	59.8744
am i to accompany you your excellency cried bertuccio	33.4587
love me too i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and a hearty frondist too  but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse  i should say you could	58.3870
but make hastei cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dants ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	1144.8728
no replied dartagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way  ah you surprise me	55.0942
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming	19.0630
this was julie who had become as the clerk of the house of thomson  french had predicted madame emmanuel herbault	17.0871
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance  alas said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all that  for me i well know my sweet girl said dartagnan	79.8233
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write	52.2152
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris  do you hesitate asked mazarin	50.6349
oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation	28.6955
make room cried dartagnan	311.6382
when crime has been committed and god doubtless in anger turns away his face it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice  40122m    have mercy on my child sir murmured villefort	90.3474
well said the baroness	9.0593
you will find me ready to follow you  they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin dartagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens	29.4698
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her king henry iv	20.9498
rochefort passed at a gallop	27.1855
30171m    yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request  you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one  never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	102.0811
the siege of la rochelle  chapter xlii	8.7474
but speak i will listen  you recollect that sad night when you were half expiring on that bed in the red damask room while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery	69.4463
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked dartagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	65.7413
never  never added porthos	42.5631
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raouls departure	12.0320
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise you  more intrigues	35.3377
men were giants in those times said athos now we are pigmies in comparison	19.0077
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet	29.7234
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night	64.7748
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least  do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end	50.5364
skirmishing	25.3915
well inquired dartagnan	90.8906
but raoul said aramis	76.4570
one of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i and monsieur de chavigny do i am sure  why does he take my comb  why do you take my lords comb asked la ramee	85.1233
when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence	57.1986
if there is any left murmured he	66.5088
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close	125.5824
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart	16.6434
in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror	15.5589
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance	59.1490
on his side however great franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it	77.1956
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear     to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you	28.6162
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits  the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort	24.7038
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	33.4597
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal  ah mercymercy cried caderousse	17.2041
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie	58.3294
m dpinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks	19.6684
ah	36.7131
you know bragelonne said athos i never speak without reflection  well comte i am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the prince de marsillac who is happily in paris just now	117.1155
all the other guests followed	55.2758
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majestya dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son	80.8149
at nine oclock then be ready here at the htel i will come and take you  planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse	85.5195
ah true said aramis	15.2095
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another  to whom  to the king  to the king  yes  i dare not write to his majesty  i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m de salvieux to do so	42.4286
she escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at boulogne without accident	13.7419
and now remember one thing monsieur officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness  40108m    i promised him to wait replied morrel and i will wait  at this moment barrois entered	81.5547
you shall soon see him	26.1539
well then it appears that we are the crsuses of the society	16.7608
is it by permission that he remains there asked gondy	121.2639
20317m    caderousse shuddered	3.9774
dartagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised	34.2575
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault chteau renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees	59.6445
now i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly	29.0255
had she betrayed him	67.5644
chapter xc	75.1664
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself	56.9477
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse	49.7721
i wish after such a scene to be alone  mazarin bent low before her	52.8973
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france  take care athos cried dartagnan dont you see they are aiming  yes yes said athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me  in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him	142.8517
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	19.2592
cavalcantis asked beauchamp	30.8338
i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence	25.4898
and now good night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	61.9540
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life	25.8558
dants would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	24.2955
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it	20.7288
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate	59.7120
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance	70.1030
dartagnan i am your prisonertreat me as such  ah	45.7796
davrigny accosted the priest	18.2948
and how  by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring	16.5239
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which dartagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence	99.6950
yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten	28.5325
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other	12.7863
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where valentines had been	14.7248
all this i did scrupulously	32.8592
1d	60.9678
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	41.5982
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	17.9639
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury  do then as i did my lord	25.4033
then you must have something on your mind said athos	26.5801
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf	33.0794
give me the pocket book la carconte and find a bag somewhere  la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag	23.1343
listen said he	7.7793
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe	149.4137
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be	55.4198
then dants departed for genoa	115.2752
never mind	7.4424
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace  good very good said porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron  at this moment nine oclock struck	90.8086
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high	20.2989
in the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed	8.1141
have i any need to tell you so	21.9231
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again  ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it	55.1301
woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison and woe to those who forgot that i was there  50229m    as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman	61.4501

i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone  in the morning when they entered miladys chamber they had brought her breakfast	40.3932
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention  make your mind easy he is in good hands  planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	71.6607
but dartagnan remained impassible	20.0133
barcelona has risen in his favor  all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow	70.9398
i will not miss you  if i give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword	21.0406
i fancied myself despised betrayed	17.6544

we can now part come i shall engage your passage  and you my dear boy  i shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to parting	69.4153
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	16.0116
this child lives and someone knows it livessomeone is in possession of our secret and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret  just god avenging god murmured madame danglars	96.8250
we will judge you in spite of your silence	43.5035
there is an excellent tavern at compigne well remembered by those who have ever been there	18.2012
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	40.6139
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	54.6391
they ask where i was born i answer	97.3884
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	15.4493
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either farias or dants cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain	515.7776
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to dartagnan	30.2756

the audience  chapter iv	38.3249
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed	32.6362
eugnie danglars i cannot in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions  ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp	91.0537

my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her	96.0171
the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia faences and palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv	9.6990
dartagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m de trville who detected him at once	64.5431

this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor	12.8730
as for aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the charactera character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its developmenthis lackey was called bazin	55.2971

i will however inform monsieur dartagnan of your arrival here  comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery	53.7942
he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes	15.3625
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf  lucien half smiled	13.4338
they were approaching the scene of war and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow	66.3089
they are no doubt both curious and interesting  yes yes but let us go	41.1652
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take	49.1169
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	33.4242
besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him	24.5656
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest	12.8604
i ask for it without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm	38.2451
then i will go to the governor of algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier i will tell him my gloomy story	23.3510
here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death	17.9544
yes i see for the young man raoul said dartagnan	24.0419
dartagnan remember this	371.0403
you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to remain  on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go	29.6162
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep	25.5952
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercds and his father could have joined him	339.4823
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages  nay indeed your excellency  i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin but let your profits end here	115.3266
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my mother in law and madame de longueville	31.9046
the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also	88.9435
run	37.4599

im not the man you take me for you are in captain rogerss post are you not	22.2268
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy	27.9788
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m danglars a visit	44.0548
villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage	48.6248
i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villeforts ball  shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked franz	41.7896
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme  20143m    and you will probably find your theme ill chosen  but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	61.6850
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents	65.9587
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte	32.5808
hes a gascon	26.3333
my idea said dartagnan	32.0326
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	71.6681
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and dartagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us  porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend	68.0692
the study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious  and what is the pay  a thousand francs sir  it is nothing  no but then we are lodged as you perceive  monte cristo looked at the room	82.5134
are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient  no said andreano it is useless for you to say so count	16.6982
wait wait you are going to know me	24.5877

the antechamber of m de trville  chapter iii	21.6398
he remained there all night not knowing where he was	38.4927
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded	39.0412
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai	102.6470
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercds the old man sank into a chair	18.4873
i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write	61.8536
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	26.8342
to be sure answered danglars	41.3695
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening  do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness  yes said the old man	145.9266
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad	24.6120
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert	43.9226
i only wish he would let me take his place  shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of mercds two oclock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour  0071m    to be sureto be sure cried dants eagerly quitting the table let us go directly  his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers	109.7337
a dead horse said dartagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours  i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over his horses mane	86.9911
we must never look for discretion in first love	57.6824
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where dartagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle	136.8998
this time said athos first breaking the silence dartagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once  the devil	37.7785
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared	15.2968
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money	30.0230

50265m    give way said the traveller	27.0315
oh	56.7705
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon	25.1046
one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left	29.8596
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish	28.7918
i am lost said he	16.1847
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him	32.5874
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	41.6173
no madame i will not thus waste your time	25.0887
no said morrel is someone dead in his house  the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness	35.8957
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	41.1657
would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison  oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month  and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel  oh yes yes  then that explains all said monte cristo	181.8072
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter	33.5778
i have not said adieu to him  a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block	62.9992
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late	31.8072
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded	18.5856
madame exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old	39.8690
were her fears realized	46.4725
meanwhile let us sit down and eat  caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor	43.6390
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers	18.2793
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty	68.0800
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life	67.4681
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de cond with the princess and dowager princess	28.7386
there i will indicate to you the best place and time  the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while dartagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmes deschaux saying to himself decidedly i cant draw back but at least if i am killed i shall be killed by a musketeer     chapter v the kings musketeers and the cardinals guards   dartagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris	163.0930
was i not nearly your husband  50056m    and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd	66.7544
he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge	54.8834
on guard  milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy	23.6438
my young man said dartagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed	34.1079
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of england	27.3764
shall i see you again soon  next week i hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and i will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much deranged  very well i shall expect you	82.0392
some one  la ramee ran in haste to obey the call	34.5266
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate  there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abb was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper	40.8167
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land	38.6279
the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded  but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing him from arrest  there has been no arrest  how  it is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes  it might be so under the bourbons but at present  it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv	234.1601
amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valrien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans	32.5843
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactioni come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter  there was a doubtful expression in noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	41.1715
dartagnan he cried	73.3219
we separated at midnight	59.7351
poverty overtook you	2.1925
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior	25.1372
to the sloop said felton and row quickly  the four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it	96.8539
i swear by  dont waste time in swearing said dartagnan let us gallop if our horses will consent  and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies	218.8998
light the candles in my apartment if you please  the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light	46.3512
where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly	14.5249
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours  it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul	154.5942
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade	30.2517
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon dartagnan when he spared the life of her brother	40.3437
she listened at eugnies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place	30.4020
he retired to his toilet	69.7834
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies	42.3396
he and the count de guiche are like each others shadows  thanks planchet thanks cried athos extending his hand to the lieutenant	21.8431
monsieur she said ii do not understand you  and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions	54.9777
i not only promise but swear it said monte cristo extending his hand	24.7209
where asked porthos filling a second glass of wine	16.0157
you cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father  20299m    we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him	67.3978
yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan  it would have required the penetration of dipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness	287.8630
you have been to yanina said he	30.2959
franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfreds shoulders or beneath laras helmet	67.7397
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help  that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them	23.5595
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of ritas father	23.1172
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yoursof your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father	65.5051
excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity funda deposit which i promised to pay this morning  oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minutes delay it would have been remarkable	67.1860
yes	93.0579
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed	21.4972
have you been to the general said mordaunt to dartagnan and porthos you know he sent for you after the action  we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied dartagnan	42.4007
one momenti begfor here are the chevalier dherblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eye witnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister	46.1948
it was the count de rochefort	19.4641
i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris  for the cause which today takes us to england  and what is this cause demanded aramis	106.8594
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner	40.4621
no everyone would do that  my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent  albert advanced towards eugnie smiling	37.7757
besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let planchet post himself behind us with his carbine  planchet is a frondeur answered dartagnan	54.6509
hayde had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier	59.6701
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice	120.7062
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw dartagnan who stood expecting her	15.6918
he was a clever man	23.8796
tell me now can you deny all this  and who told you this fine story sire asked trville quietly	34.3058
i was dancing the galop at torlonias with the countess g then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped	20.1256
that voice also was known to grimaud	112.4330
they went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden	58.9696
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us  no pardieu though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse	31.0345
the fair worshipper touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the church	43.4903
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview	30.3044
mercds extended her hand to the count	7.8496
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him  wretch exclaimed hayde her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery	153.7470
pardon gentlemenpar murmured the voice which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds	22.2290
my life belongs to my cash	20.2752
if he comes  shall we not know it  how  nothing easier	62.5408
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me  athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	49.3689
you see i destroy it  oh exclaimed dants you are goodness itself  listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done  oh command and i will obey  listen this is not a command but advice i give you  speak and i will follow your advice  i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice	345.7067
forward  aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the others	31.8908
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you  you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude  as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	13.3931
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that dartagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood	49.9547
oh what a dreadful event cried maximilian	38.8285
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	39.8934
oh more than i can say kitty	64.1979
i told you so athos said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	17.8529
where are your musketeers	31.3749
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away	36.6762
planchet said dartagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one below	25.0142
i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind	63.5774
the return   dartagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation	35.8668
the yard was empty the clock was striking twelve	37.9234
do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him	28.6657
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris she inquired	37.8795
she is perhaps a prisoner she is perhaps dead  yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted while i  well  nothing replied aramis nothing  so you renounce the world then forever that is a settled thinga resolution registered  forever	58.3869
cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars asked beauchamp	14.9528
it was a signal	19.0884
if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the     young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit     may obtain his pardon	28.9178
a small white cloud which had attracted dants attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the chteau dif	9.4055
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of others  and beppo led him outside the walls said the count	29.2004
the standard  very well in half an hour we shall be on board  and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england  what do you say of that young man asked dartagnan as they hurried along	39.3466
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon	81.6643
now i dont set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies	52.6242
theres what you want on that table said the waiter	55.9594
then those who dwelt in bonacieuxs unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture	22.3773
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	106.1638
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage  bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused and then said at what oclock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready  at five oclock replied the count	126.9751
the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the counts orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond	107.6389
the rencontre	1498.8197
1f5	92.4545
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused	27.3791
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there  yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	37.6729
you see i give you a wide range	21.1237
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend	20.4288
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse	27.5487
all had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew mme	76.7671
onward cried porthos	4.5478
begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes  very well it is your own doing	28.4034
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil	41.1485
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself  an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits you	32.3046
of what nature  why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage  certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one  now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain  franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination	64.6816
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall see him	15.3554
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket	83.6112
yes a thousand times yes  and who completed it as it now is  i did	45.5574
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn	14.8290

i have since learned that he was confined in the chteau dif and i should like to learn some particulars of his death  what was his name  the abb faria  oh i recollect him perfectly cried m de boville he was crazy  so they said  oh he was decidedly  very possibly but what sort of madness was it  he pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him  poor deviland he is dead  yes sir five or six months ago last february  you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well  i recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular incident  may i ask what that was said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance	45.6027
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere	75.1343
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct	16.4012
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst  yes added planchet like the famous ass of buridan	92.3321
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green  oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republics which deputed david12 to devise a uniform for the academicians  indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician  within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly  and what is his especial talent  his talent	100.9353
everyone hastened to purchase moccolettifranz and albert among the rest	25.7817
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you  you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to  it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	79.4927
immediately replied dartagnan we have not a minute to lose  hello grimaud	32.7661
i arose	2156.5383
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st peters	5.7530
let me overtake him  he	13.7740
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	52.3709
bonacieux entered	211.7424

why has he not painted a spot upon his heartit would have been more simple  meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men	51.3016
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed	47.9953
but he did not succeed	16.6627
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie	29.5789
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel	52.7911
and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend  0037m    worthy caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us  yes to be sure i am	58.4251
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies	161.2463
to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb	39.6476
50231m    maximilian said the count you should not look on the graves but there and he pointed upwards	27.7198
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbands good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk	78.4254
i am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right  reassure yourself madame i will answer for the kings safety  as he left the queens presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	77.0730
she was still exceedingly handsome	22.9671
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	17.3814
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden	79.8414
and with my grandfathers consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you  valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them	128.1402
yes continued the cardinal	16.9819
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme	19.1016
that was not the appointed hour	25.0153
it is i who lose my cause and it is ill luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me  to what do you refer said monte cristo with well feigned interest	52.1316
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in	6.3218
at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	17.1116
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping	40.0933
now attach him to our party	47.4929
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards franz  are you m franz de quesnel baron dpinay asked he although he knew it perfectly	68.3646
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hopeher only means of safety	45.2778
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees	9.0560
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his	44.2915
from him whom you have rendered the happiest of men   comte de wardes   this note was in the first place a forgery it was likewise an indelicacy	23.3608
now let us go  50205m    these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement	26.3771
50223m    ah yes i see said the count in a voice hoarse from emotion	13.6256
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos	67.8896
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs	37.3372
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	25.8117
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself  and he began his story	48.0841
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti  count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow	13.2122
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance  mother we have no more money  50141m    mercds had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference	968.2637
he was a stout man of about two  or three and twenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach	26.6430
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses  i have no horse said dartagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de trvilles  that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine  one of yours	77.0375
he is very susceptible  bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself  true	33.4885
milady was there as it were where you sit athos changed color	76.1367
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo i introduce no one and certainly not m cavalcanti  and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly  what	55.6315
that will fall in wonderfully well you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the queen  then the cardinal added a propos sire do not forget to tell her majesty the evening before the fte that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her     chapter xvii	76.8064
one by the post madame danglars footman left the other  let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box	59.7746
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip	24.9137
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard	27.1797
the races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	13.5299
speak out  are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror asked another	51.8486
in which the plot thickens  chapter xii	12.1773
do you know what consoled him	9.3921
you were rich noble held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy  all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all  and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness  only one thing said the italian	99.1632
brute said danglars	15.2881
sir what gratitude i feel exclaimed the man with gray hair	73.7571
have you it asked raoul  yesthat is i had it repined the gascon making believe to find it	32.3000
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle	35.9435
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers  the countess made no reply	55.4608
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy  come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her  her  20183m    the beautiful greek of yesterday  no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible  when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains  where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	141.7578
this is fine said porthos to himself i am prettily caught  he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme	35.6827
what he continued can i have been following a false pathcan the end which i proposed be a mistaken endcan one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking	74.7961
at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmontes country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey	70.7987
you see said athos	15.0996
the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galley slaves you said i may escape from prison i cannot from the grave and you said truly the way was opened for you unexpectedly	169.2165
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free	18.6235
to morrow night we shall rescue you  how can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy	56.0323
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it	32.6863
by demanding my head of the cardinal cried dartagnan pale with terror	25.1370
does he regret me a little	15.6574
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they eat	22.8441
ifaith yes said athos for i am hungry  look out for the black fowls cried aramis	27.8064
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered	83.2873
i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile	120.2054
how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass youve not then forgotten me  forget you	55.3620
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves	41.0127
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	24.8782
the concert must be a delightful one  they suit each other remarkably well said danglars	37.5944
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel	22.4724
thats another thing said dartagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question	47.4573
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window	10.5677
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner  oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall  and why parry  do not look i implore you my king  but what is the matter	33.3257
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville  i did go there  well  she was no longer there but she had left her new address  where was she  guess i give you a thousand chances  how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight	105.9088
and now whenever he wishes  well whenever he wishes  planchet began to sing  un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin je crois quil gronde contre le mazarin	22.2862
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall	123.5668
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	35.2545
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall	26.9766
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel	81.8575
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	91.2914
on cried dartagnan all goes well	89.9820
there are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow	76.6598
what is to be said	20.2511
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume	13.4275
near the barrels stood selim my fathers favorite whom i mentioned to you just now	33.2414
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me	63.1456
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	12.9707
that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelors revenue could not suffice for the coming months outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs	32.1044
you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used  sir replied raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me	65.6648
and we did not surrenderno	29.0367
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination	102.3536
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead  you make me tremble said the young girl	50.3913
the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law  i know it sir replied monte cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	178.7295
1d	73.1560
the shutter where eugnie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed	22.3982
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter  but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	60.9713
chapter lxxii	125.3160
dants cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven	358.8870
not at all  why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there beforemaking in all about two hundred francswhy i should certainly be arrested at the barriers	115.3403
oh how happy you make us	37.5353
and now  now escort me  where  where i am going  but where are you going  you will see because you will leave me at the door  shall i wait for you  that will be useless  you will return alone then  perhaps yes perhaps no  but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman  i dont know yet  but i will know it  how so  i will wait until you come out  in that case adieu  why so  i do not want you  but you have claimed  the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy  the word is rather hard  how are they called who follow others in spite of them  they are indiscreet  the word is too mild  well madame i perceive i must do as you wish  why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once  is there no merit in repentance  and do you really repent  i know nothing about it myself	121.3976
jump then monsieur pistache  but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	40.5112
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte	24.5412
back already	336.9782
you would follow the escort exclaimed porthos in dismay	53.5559
you will not leave me to perish	16.8400
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous	67.0708
then dartagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this dartagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	29.8814
halloo grimaud  grimaud appeared	39.4090
m morrel unhappy exclaimed the abb	38.4556
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans	19.0023
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron	18.9923
peter blessed with the fingers	9.0207
however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian lifea life of politeness visiting and introductions  monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty	49.1288
he said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	29.8472
a family affair   athos had invented the phrase family affair	13.8275
the three friendsfor as we have said athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himselfwent out early in the morning and returned late at night	21.7116
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes  who then urged you to write	261.9229
he repaired therefore immediately to his htel and caused himself to be announced	30.7610
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of braccianos but also return to florence alone  if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least	36.8182

through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park	12.5576
then he must be playing in the garden go and see  50193m    no sir madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since  a cold perspiration burst out on villeforts brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch	56.0888
she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter then shaking his head sorrowfully poor hayde said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something	36.4030

i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her	11.8895
that is of the first importance  attend to it then at once  unfortunately it is a thing that i cant perform at any time i choose	37.7913
he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king  sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen  i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases  do what monsieur de la fere requests that is your name is it not sir  i have another name madamei am called athos  madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled  you hear sir said the queen	64.2149
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle	71.2492
you must stop at the little village of eccuis in which there is but one tavernthe shield of france	17.1854
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugnie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart	75.9548
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included	46.8403
for the moment she wished nothing better	65.6157
as to the duc de bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the duc delbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff	33.5166
now said he the sacrifice is consummated	35.2999
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously	47.8374
he is not curious thought dartagnan	73.0703
good evening madame said the banker good evening m debray  probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day	75.3044
you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead	17.3735
the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea	382.5770
i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish	54.3746
what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand	22.9776
very good signor pastrini said franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days  as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage  what as to the carriage exclaimed albert	47.9125
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you	18.6981
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth	79.4329
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality	18.1432
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope	82.7957
just so  why he is a second ariosto  no his name is the count of monte cristo  there is no count of monte cristo said debray	14.9623
bonacieux	12.6070
it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her	45.0983
this point settled the duke turned to dartagnan	41.3855
it is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted talisman  i dont at all understand you but i believe all you say to be true	16.7960
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	44.4909
your song is as dismal as a de profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out  silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton	150.5149
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone  and dartagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy	86.5264
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them	1438.5548
you see there are two wanting  eight days my lord  i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow  my lord they shall be yours  you are a jewel of a man mr oreilly but that is not all	71.4561
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it	21.1681
i have not said good morning to you monsieur dartagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you	38.7474
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph  at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit	52.1583
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu then they gained the private staircase and dartagnan was ushered into the oratory	25.6851
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you  i pledge you my word madam said the abb that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly  ah thats all very fine retorted the woman	217.4928
oh	73.2760
and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house  your excellency it is done already	39.4020
he cannot make me forget what i shall have lost  thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on	73.7142
yes  and who is the man  i do not know  why did he not bring it to me here  the messenger did not say  and where is the messenger  he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you  oh said the countess to franz go with all speedpoor young man	25.3399
they all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of one	40.2404
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them	44.8506
really said planchet	63.2876
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the kings attorney  you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us	42.3810
you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave paris bringing them with you to cours la reine	31.0693
0319m    you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse	25.8241
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal linesgod knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc dangoulme themselves watched over by the cardinalan inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days	105.2645
like women not like queens  egad	97.9398
but that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess	20.8775
two remained with the men in black who rummaged every place and took all the papers	33.7294
mme	30.2597
athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen	23.9580
we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	58.4949
caderousses knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue	62.8116
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	40.1826
besides dartagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits	23.3414
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	86.7091
the king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment	123.5540
the two things agree marvelously well  i am all attention said dartagnan	25.1797
let him come  yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come  moreover he is but a child said aramis	39.9303
in that case let there be no more question of whats past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him  aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar	127.7337
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed	112.4555
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night	16.7676

we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions	11.0695
i neither know nor care	82.5919
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear	14.6112
well take your hat and gloves returned monte cristo	31.4067
monsieur bazin the beadle said the verger	39.9096
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this	20.2940
they entered	115.9406
i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame de saint mran	35.3009
they are no longer sure  planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton	61.5698
nothing therefore was settled that day as emerys head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence	38.9312
let dartagnan speak said athos you know he always has wise advice to give  clearly said dartagnan we must go where they will not look for us	46.0423
desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire	42.5750
and now once more adieu said morrel	54.3070
well before dying i wish to see my son in law	40.5920
the juncture was favorable	25.4711
and shall we take no notice of this incident m de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	16.4139
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	111.3041
let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night	26.1847
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room	32.4906
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries	35.1765
ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty	73.3563
i beg you to do so replied albert	15.4198
they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies  which means  which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen	68.2978
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when dartagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand	73.1469
ah said gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all france might hear it that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty  exactly your man  bravo	269.5139
15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father	40.5455
ah said beauchamp you doubt me	37.4806
see if he is still in the same place  athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole	35.0889
the sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy font	21.4229
his eminence cannot see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary  bernouin re entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds	37.7460
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment	61.7722
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied	38.4991
thats all right my dear aramis take care of yourself said he i will go alone in search of athos  you are a man of brass replied aramis	25.4609
50095m    i rave said morrel well then i appeal to m davrigny himself	30.5637
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion  but a humpbacked general	31.0862
i imagined it must be said morrel	39.1762
from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them	19.5327
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes	135.4510
i have answered for you	42.7710
but said morrel the culpritthe murdererthe assassin  do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said villefort	20.7797
haste said felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead  then continued milady then i collected all my strength i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck	38.3387
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage	82.6304
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind dartagnan still directing them from behind with his voice	81.8119
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both	73.7042
m	98.9235
i will shape it out for you with my knife  and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	33.4554
try and find a seatthere is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper  beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak  indeed	56.5024
this time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape	52.0250
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	25.3073
you smile  yes  why do you do so  i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	57.6298
oh my heart	92.7417
why was i a prisoner  i do not know said mercds	35.8562
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead  go sir count replied dartagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england	52.6956
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened	19.6662
he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart	22.4018
many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view	25.3869
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments	28.3173
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony  at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him	9.3001
he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dants was beloved by them	15.6889
a waiter opened the door	21.8000
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there  anne of austria started	26.7487
the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors  if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands  wait wait said the duke	88.2096
really that demoiselle daubigne is very charming  so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished	63.7191
you  yes  you have them  i have them  ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48000 francsah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them  i do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the abb busoni thought for you  he is an excellent person  he is extremely prudent and thoughtful  he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you  here they are  the major clasped his hands in token of admiration	80.7462
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	8.1644
repeat it	9.4852
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to dartagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel	22.0601
should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search hearts a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy  sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me	61.1781
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier	31.0382
stay	49.1573
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving	19.4590
one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever	34.3723
athos bowed	467.7937
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest dartagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille  go to	60.8823
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis  yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand	20.7335
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have called him in my long sleepless nights how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them	50.0220
it was the duc de beaufort who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians intoxicated with joy	17.3608
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	28.1945
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	67.8501
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses	21.5930
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality	17.5633
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure	51.5368
you put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as i told you  oh monsieur	31.3244
i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known  good my son	35.5374
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	27.3471
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes	23.0265
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder	52.7054
is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago  certainly not longer  well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week	32.2073
about seven oclock in the evening the boatman had taken over a young woman wrapped in a black mantle who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized but entirely on account of her precautions the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty	19.2951
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortunesir i cannot understand your generosity  oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others  then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something  50227m    what have you to offer to me my friend	85.2361
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came	29.5243
the avenger	1631.9486
dartagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses	125.1198
two openings have been made in these caves the treasure is in the furthest angle in the second which treasure i bequeath and leave entire to him as my sole heir	92.0913
she should have wanted nothing  have you ever seen the queen of england inquired dartagnan	50.7229
when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows	24.2185
tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs  the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a manhe became a number	65.3939
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	157.3553
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored  withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons  you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver	80.9189
ho	85.7735
i make a match	67.6845
but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass	41.1620
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission	36.7417
i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor  because i was shown up the private stairs  how so  i know not it must have been a mistake  mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing	37.1800
the procureur exerted himself to reply	20.7705
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated	23.3725
if you were to die i should die too  the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips	19.1697
what am ithe law	9.5778
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy and by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness	77.2477
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	29.0242
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation	28.7956
you will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed mazarin between two doors	31.8195
major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence continued monte cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million  monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed	50.2550
i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless  next daynext day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dants was arrested  yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me	62.4405
but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour	31.0952
the kings attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly  farewell madame farewell  that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioners knife	40.7705
he did not dare to write for fear of not being ableto such experienced eyes as those of miladyto disguise his writing sufficiently	14.0338
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m dpinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed	50.8894
luigi vampa  if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven oclock the count albert will have ceased to live  this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him	68.1758
alas	15.1738
all is ready for to morrow evening	32.1741
one of my friendsone of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my provincethat is to say of berrynoble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint	115.2128
he was a strong minded upright young man	7.4883
in a court of justice that is called an alibi  dartagnan found his advice prudent	28.3250
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal  what	190.9282
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless  and how was m de saint mran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count	76.4721
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted	66.3891
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house  where you can be relieved asked de guiche	67.4402
do you wish a step or some place in the government  sir will you grant me my request  let us hear what it is first  sir when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer let me see that order  if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill  when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have i ever replied it is impossible  but a request preferred with so much preparation  ah do not fear sir said mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you  well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request proceed  sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them  for their ransom	93.5131
when he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk	24.9122
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay	23.7004
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis	40.8370
rely on me  dartagnan knew that although a gascon m de trville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his word	30.7097
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco  50241m    danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting house	67.1303
milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was coming	39.2361
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer	17.5618
that instant the arm of porthos fell	50.9260
still further in buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme	53.3720
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine	67.7501
you may be easy thenyoull get there  dartagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters	25.3153
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying if she had committed two crimes i would say here m de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted withone that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations	286.0363
besides dartagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her	32.7509
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something about poetry  who is this officer inquired raoul of athos who is speaking  monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near monsieur scarron  raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived	163.8827
hush said the captain it is a fire  but you told me the island was uninhabited  i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers  and for pirates  and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franzs words	41.9870
why did you not come down to breakfast	14.9793
grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the diamond	34.5924
the count knit his brow	16.8179
let me have some dinner  at once	34.8806
ah sblood how you have hurt me	29.7450
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names  but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce  i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain  it is my intention so to do come let us hear you	251.6579
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well	21.9847
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries	46.3261
oh you beautiful good little creature said milady	80.0618
richelieu   and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can  and he left the chamber without once looking behind him	63.1690
it is a duel then cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation	31.8211
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman	19.4764
valentine opened her eyes	12.2275
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks	20.7213
by the female side i believe said the procurator maliciously	19.5027
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other comrades	128.0620
it was written and signed by albert	79.5028
how many people thought he and not one true friend  and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said  respect to fallen majesty  the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart	92.0651
everything goes as if in flowery paths  everything goes too well porthos	15.3102
we will grow old together and talk of our companions  no replied dartagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin i wish to be there i expect to get something by it  what do you expect to get  why i expect to be made marechal of france  ha	174.6580
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house	32.7314
pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true	29.4408
but in this world we must risk something	56.1260
egad i know where he is said dartagnan	22.5836
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dants repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	36.7256
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brotherthat is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	22.9515
what fine things we would do together  yes said porthos	71.8436
i indeed invited them here today on your account	64.0059
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache	36.9453
to day i am engaged in a different affair	27.4330
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you  milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse	34.0070
yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity	13.1592
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos	23.3964
the conversation took a cheerful turn	109.3647
would you like to become rich or at least independent	26.9298
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity	23.2393
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys	11.3631
you know he has estatesporthos  i should think so indeed	20.0168
he did not look like an executioner  and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office  but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	107.5454
satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions athos returned to the htel and found planchet impatiently waiting for him	16.9482
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister	74.1749
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears  i also said aramis	22.1748
no	96.2924
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes repeated	53.0724
but take no notice we know all about that  well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple  what asked dartagnan	29.8184
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing	34.1112
you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself  no i do not wish to come between a father and son	49.1600
but dartagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	44.1059
you have made up your mind at last my lord said rochefort	19.7345
take twenty five of them aramis and give me the remaining twenty five  all right i am glad to see you are of my opinion	38.3983
you see he has a truly royal escort  ay theres no fear in the daytime but at night  we redouble our precautions  and what method of surveillance do you employ  eight men remain constantly in his room  the deuce he is well guarded then	171.3592
listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with wearinessfor four days i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for maximilian  the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her	126.8485
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking	44.1409
seeing dartagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes	39.6296
now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon	66.3822
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ballthat which contained the letter  the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud	28.2773
dartagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet	45.1634
beware my dear dartagnan	9.6631
to whom was this letter addressed  to m noirtier rue coq hron no	15.3504
1d	53.2972
athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau	37.8806
i suspected where she was concealed	104.9323

my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart  and he gave him his hand	33.8265

the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave dartagnan uneasiness	67.3376
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtiers breathing came thick and short	26.1215

yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man  athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword	34.5478
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care	121.1415
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them	26.7785
it may be supposed that dants did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal	33.2570

no i searched the whole thicket	41.8646
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	35.5673
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but i know he must be so at present  we thought so too monsieur	45.0448
they are veritable sponges	14.7554

morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	81.0556

our bark flew before the wind	12.4488
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended	35.0066

oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly	30.1277
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators	50.4133
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said  milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	26.9053

buckingham had returned to london mme	43.7770
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other  and which of them made this passage  oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abb was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea  blind fools murmured the count	128.9769
before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion	26.6800
we want money for our return to paris  i am much attached to that horse athos  and there again you are wrong	53.1310
my lord said the guard i have simply mentioned the prophecy i heard from a man named coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the duke of beaufort will escape before whitsuntide  coysel is a madman returned the cardinal	96.1034
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante your emotion has quite overcome you  his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear	80.8999

this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside	58.7762
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france	39.6939
the same had been done for the queen and madame the president	43.5851
go then and find them  what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence  you know them better than i adapt your promises to their respective characters  what shall i promise  that if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent  but what are we to do  make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what i require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your friends  my lord perhaps they are not in paris	71.5314

baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive  danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their hands	29.4269
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me  bravo cried chteau renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism	38.8150
each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them	19.3095
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it to morrow  raoul didnt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	121.2018
whoever did it writes well	27.5923
ah ah murmured he is dants then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form	23.7911

good byei must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again	36.9842
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dants was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	74.1344
i will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons	56.6666

zounds	26.9662
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain	56.4936
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches	18.4589
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas  this wound my dear dartagnan has been a warning to me from heaven  this wound	30.9191

at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual	80.2599
yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit	30.9856
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope	18.5752

let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit monsieur dartagnan will enjoy our conversation better  yes replied dartagnan i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me  certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon dartagnan a look full of gratitude	66.2534
the deliverance of the cardinal perhaps	33.0746
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better  this exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder	17.8097
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	13.7191
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied dartagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you  it seems nevertheless  come gentlemen come said dartagnan aloud i have no motive for defending monsieur	79.2996
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions	9.2561

disguised  it was very boldly written if disguised  stop a bit said the abb taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation	342.9530
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	11.3830
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so  there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old  let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is bertuccio bowed	67.7053

when i say i want i mean the queen wants them	44.6719
judge if i should not put myself under its protection  flattery was at that period very current and m de trville loved incense as well as a king or even a cardinal	16.9961
but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not	56.0455
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day	33.3360
aramis bit his lips till the blood came	14.6331
de saint mran  yes  suddenly  from an apoplectic stroke  an apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor	16.1497
as he departed danglars approached and said  well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo  yes most satisfactory my dear danglars  well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty  dants has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	164.5408
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio	23.5134
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty	71.6916

we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said dartagnan and share the three hundred  we will share said porthos	36.4873
dartagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong	70.3502
i was obliged to brand the guilty one and he gentlemen was my brother	49.4336
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks	25.8651

with monsieur  monsieur has returned then  of course naively replied the servant	86.1953
he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard nothing	27.5729
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you	15.1353
all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted dartagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint	98.7084
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn	27.1813
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation	98.9125
answer me  on what i could get  you lie repeated the abb a third time with a still more imperative tone	39.8809
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before	78.7833
to wait replied athos	82.2601
deuce take it cried dartagnan more moved than he had been for a long time dont despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one  oh really cried raoul	36.9101
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man	25.2204
and with what did you contrive to make that inquired dants	52.4584
it was that of a man from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries	98.9210
speak out sir said mordaunt	54.5698
shake handsi crave your friendship  sir said raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand i like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend i beseech you  and now where are you going viscount inquired de guiche	274.2260
i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken  whom do you mean asked aramis	21.6914
felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments  i thought so my lord said felton but as the prisoner is a woman after all i wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own  milady shuddered through her whole system	59.0298
no was the old mans reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercds should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moments repose  but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	67.2790
a light cloud passed over the counts face	19.4825
what new gibberish is that  he says he is german my lord replied raoul but i doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective  then you speak german also asked the prince	94.9772
her crimes i know them not her disorders i know them not her vices i know them not	26.9207
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed	65.8764
but to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever  you are right said morrel calmly	7.5519
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs	37.5615
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	55.4901
i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale  the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask	89.5989
i have replied dartagnan	45.2373
dartagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you  he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber	42.3826
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porters lodge saying  pray does not the count of monte cristo live here  his excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali	77.4577
this last reason appeared convincing	48.0142
major bartolomeo cavalcanti	2.8572
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	69.2641
are there not some latin verses upon that subject	24.1257
but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first	47.4499
these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village	24.2384
dartagnan was radiant with joy and pride	9.5527
we dont know the locality and shall never find the wall	43.5487
furthermore dartagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow	85.5635
take care of the executioner dartagnan  all right	45.8191
he was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late	35.5149
dartagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity	33.3098
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant	36.1595
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her	19.3523
do you think so sir	8.0289

monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur dartagnan theres not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him  then my lord replied dartagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much youunderstand me  be it so	84.2022

on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux as athos had just left dartagnan to report at m de trvilles as nine oclock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street door	45.1206

well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abb adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly  it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	564.4203

near her was mademoiselle louise darmilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of	32.2954
you surely will not do that my dear count  certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it  well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me  i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	63.9558

what do you wish sir asked morrel that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hands	26.7502
necessity has no law besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least	21.8123

the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the chteau dif giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper	111.8157

the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte daix	396.0612
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory	41.8190
if they ask it what have i to say  that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	32.1585
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse  well  it is a forgery  how can that be  yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you  but it is dartagnan that will come  do not deceive yourself	57.9166
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	182.0842

what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church	8.0823
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree	115.2103
so he cherishes no resentment  you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	10.6776
pray forgive me  but there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was it is not only your reserve which afflicts me  what is it then asked the young girl	55.1300
26  on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge	29.6492
what are you doing asked he	6.5734
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond	33.6610
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives	288.7962
yesthat is a great word sir	21.4169
dartagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed	23.8064
you have no right to put me to death alone	28.6729
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved	54.4801

during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen	32.5240
would you have given up the letter aramis said dartagnan	23.3388
to day the third will be there also  as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out  yes if your majesty releases them  ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris  why so  on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure  madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain paris with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein  anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand	57.2775
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things  what did you please to say sir asked caderousse	57.9245
you to be sure said dartagnan pressing athoss hand	18.8031
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures	45.5872
mme	42.0928
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to dartagnan that the would be assassin had saved his life	47.1075
oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him  in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper	35.6752
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	14.4966

but whats going on in the city yonder said athos	28.5541
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down	31.3243
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her	49.6141
do not surrender egad	20.6492
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	64.9231
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes  it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshals staff to offer you  oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur	32.0159
mercds begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond  so that said the abb with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all	73.1984
oliver cromwell  mr	3.0047
confiteor said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry paralyzed  have you finished said andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat	167.1158
but grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses	54.0206
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it  but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me  30101m    this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	50.4288
good said he our syndic is at his post  he knocked and the door was opened	20.5672
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met	29.7521
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant	62.4952
what is that line cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak	8.7687
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses  danglars took advantage of caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went	52.9513
how many shots  a hundred  thats quite as many as we shall want	38.2314
yes monseigneur replied the officer	20.5006
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me	48.6722
she what she asked dartagnan	156.9405
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first timethis garden the actual scene of my crimemust have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause	63.8508
these horses are equipped for the field	26.7840
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	25.4986
felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers	18.4251
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastilewhere he remained for twelve long yearswhen his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court	68.2289
all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse	40.2385
bonacieux	41.8938
alone	51.3743
0301m    dants dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	28.6710
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible possessed that ever existed	78.8893
there is no god there is no providenceall comes by chance  there is a providence there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him  but who are you then asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	107.7835
where am i said she	23.4584
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save	62.4102
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything	42.1339
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me	28.3271
sdeath he cried with his gascon accent	22.6528
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell  oh	46.2117
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery	53.0490
dead repeated a third voice	195.0646
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble  sir you have indeed lost a son but  villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard	18.3392
bonacieux	51.9364
in truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die	18.2556
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action	22.0156
jealousy gnawed his heart and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber	30.8470
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dants over the crew and himself	59.7923
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans  go my dear boy said old dants and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son  his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dants she is not his wife yet as it seems to me  no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond	50.9780
be punished alone for the first miserable man said lord de winter to felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea but i swear to you by the memory of my brother whom i have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved  felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable	109.1776
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord  dartagnan then returning to the officer said  sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminences order and that i shall await him at the stables  the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter	125.0617
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass  are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears	77.6124
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal	30.8796
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all  he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugnie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	103.4482
dartagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods	61.3995
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets	33.7856
40044m    general dpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	32.5741
1e5	40.6655
dartagnan was the first to recover from his surprise	16.7710
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs	21.9912
can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties	7.4104

years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years  ah yes i understand said mazarin want of fortune perhaps	41.3091
let us alight here said athos	14.7169
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background	24.0461
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	12.4053
in madame de villeforts room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall	22.3180
bazin	83.9881
they thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it i am ready to go  ah	35.2068
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the eventthat is to say till two oclock in the afternoontwo vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admirals ship	59.6534
and after this reasoning she slept easily	54.3770
he will do anything i wish	34.8005
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him	19.5325
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret	15.9830
oh cried the inspector who can live here  a most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute  he is alone  certainly  how long has he been there  nearly a year  was he placed here when he first arrived  no not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him  to kill the turnkey  yes the very one who is lighting us	90.1626
listen to me  edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	35.8346
the money is nothing that letter was everything	216.4496
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	24.1141
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	28.4453
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result  at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail  none whatever	32.3577
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos	25.7212
ah	74.9840
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple	58.6784
confess you know i have the right of giving absolution  i monseigneur said athos	27.3088
will you come said he to porthos	26.9875
is that your name monsieur  my very own	104.3919
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or lost  ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all  i can understand that said dartagnan	86.0681
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love	128.2007
ah cried dartagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it  well merit this pretended happiness then  i am at your orders said dartagnan	90.5036
and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you  he did  and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter  yes  and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier  yes  why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed	174.7387
his family will care much about such a trifle as that	70.7253
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	8.0176
a million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep	39.0173
two royal pages were playing with him	13.3450
yes you see i am as exact as you are	18.7250
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother  bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning	45.7905
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions	23.4111
what	39.2028
at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man	20.2632
athos aramis and dartagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender	30.0815
besides what does the gospel say	21.9495
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast	25.4463
behold madame	41.0272
the reader hushed herself instantly	24.1696
dartagnan	46.5958
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage	107.7921
a man	15.4457
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldnt serve mazarin	38.8683
he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious  i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrnathat is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life  and your precautions were successful  completely so  yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort  indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited i really did not remember  i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south  and that is the case observed monte cristo	399.6504
the devil thought porthos this is poor work	100.5994
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking	34.8412
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length dartagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick	44.9545
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face	47.5719
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment	59.3697
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost	45.9366
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon	8.4376
psi now believe in italian banditti  below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian  se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avr cessato di vivere	125.5184
as to that said aramis we are witnesses	30.3759
drink this and then take nothing more tonight  valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear	56.7256
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon  and  and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort  ah	28.5800
the count praised bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month	23.4666
he will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been there	45.6479
he took the child in his arms embraced him shook him called him but the child made no response	36.5252
how fast you go	72.4903
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught	24.2266
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	61.9988
dartagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it	26.6504
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf	38.9001
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him	35.9053
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends  ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature and he withdrew sighing	62.8377
mademoiselle eugnie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel	35.2749
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start	33.8649
i will bless youi  i am dying cried mordaunt come to me	26.8201
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother	39.2249
where is he  waiting below in my carriage  seek him at once  i hasten to do so  the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again	102.5669
there is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude	20.9021
have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival	30.7025
yes had i died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny	67.1222
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them  the queen spoke with some impatience	34.5928

she loves him it was for his sake she has committed these crimes	41.7327
i thought they might be useful so i took them  meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols	37.1287
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest	16.5438

it was a lovely starlight nightthey had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into lightwaves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous oceanwaves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes dowaves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp	307.1644

count added mercds with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof  i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another  but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not  the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	251.7876

he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him	22.3477
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abb busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth	107.7044

yes yes	23.5839
he seized a rope which dants flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner	98.1968
the past is another thing said athos sighing the past and the future  are you afraid for your young raoul asked aramis	36.6450
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights	221.9510

if we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse  and you say this treasure amounts to  two millions of roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our money2  impossible said dants staggered at the enormous amount	73.8829

no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	26.8274
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite	16.8095

people cry out long live the king	18.8520
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude  you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first  we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham	30.2944
four other noblemen awaited me	10.7129

no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies  milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity	189.6056

the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street	12.2540

not at all my young man	32.7375
oh	99.0658
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i cannot allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy  you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form  the fact is hazarded dartagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis	56.5191
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara	135.0532
morrel smiled and shook his head	15.1124
the days of expectation are long and dartagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours	50.0433
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo	24.0730
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	73.5192
a nice acquaintance my friend  porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the women  gentlemen gentlemen cried dartagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious	67.2544
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	26.0920
why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered  can i believe my ears cried the marquise	22.8846
villefort perceiving the abb passed his hand across his brow	15.4064
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them  you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide	44.1152
the invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable	37.4160
i congratulate you	36.0737
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	19.2824
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter  yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort	24.5987

when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination	159.0983
thanksthanks but fortunately i do not want for anything and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me dants made a gesture	36.3455
oh yes was the ready answer	230.5222

chapter 109 the assizes  the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation	84.5053
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out  by the telegraph sire louis xviii	33.7289
salute my hero viscount  and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten	109.3335
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month  and what did the doctor answer asked monte cristo	78.7397
but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe	32.7807
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns	16.3605
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak	32.1235
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth	37.3781
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours	43.4766
then valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds	38.7375
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here  he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality  by the way m de chteau renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel  ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him	28.7919
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face	20.9940
nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers	99.0028
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards  i will do more than i promise said dants	62.7837
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	38.2290

madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment	22.7138
that happened as i told you in 1829 for gods sake tell me did you know this englishman  but you tell me also that the house of thomson  french have constantly denied having rendered you this service  yes  then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation  everything is possible in this affair even a miracle  what was his name asked monte cristo	94.0510
heagain cried porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is made of iron  oh my god muttered athos	24.2076
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering  but sir he has fled let him escapeinaction is a pardonable offence  i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute  sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior  villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal	580.9967
have you the diamond continued athos	49.9912
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there	23.1540
monte cristo smiled	9.2965
but i think i have it said athos	24.5362
it is a mixture of excellent opium which i fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the eastthat is between the tigris and the euphrates	22.8337
besidesdo you see that door athos  yes what then  well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air  i recognize you there my brave dartagnan replied athos but you are no longer our masters	92.0714
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500000 or 600000 livres	52.6614
those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm	8.8720
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers	29.0668

the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body	161.2844
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand	29.4474
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city	27.3361
it was in the rue des france bourgeois close to la force	17.4590
thats what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio	36.6494
yes my lord it is i i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly  and dartagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking	22.9217
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth  and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned  unquestionably  so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time  precisely  20027m    but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman	127.6381
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber	34.3127
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him	182.7464
happily dartagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties	13.3299
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man  he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	56.4308
ah thanks felton thanks  the young man pressed her to his heart	33.6531
my first business will be to dispose of this diamond  so saying the abb again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse	50.7635
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it	58.7237
meantime dartagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	23.7749
dants continued his search	120.6282
the child accepted joyfully	85.6337
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me  oh oh said dartagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso	43.9840
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper  beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf	223.4003
help  sir said comminges declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king  i obey i obey sir cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority	154.9180
he brought me up as if i had been his son and in 1814 he married	39.8904
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty	39.6624
whence have you these ideas of death  you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your sonchallenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victoryyou do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live	55.9628
returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet	22.3872
he saw dartagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	31.0640
return whence you came take back those horrible vegetables and that poor kickshaw	48.2440
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope	25.0829
he stepped forward	85.3156
the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of hayde	32.9506
formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman but now it was a different thing he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general	30.5754
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod	164.9317
he did not speak but showed the paper to dants	52.2462
dants could thus keep his eyes on marseilles	80.0111
chapter xxii	65.6478
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinalhis physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur	16.6747
he had foreseen all	40.0715
hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst  bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	43.8822
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he  madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	106.5447
his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever	14.3319
i have chosen a trade  a trade	23.3857
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers	69.0889
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	25.3350
besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair	44.6743
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers	10.5055
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	41.1065
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly	19.3051
i am cold i am hungry	46.2946
do what i tell you and immortality awaits you  villefort fell on his knees	22.0130
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death	16.6935
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers  all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	43.9333
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last	18.0038
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease	11.9434
where are we going inquired aramis are we going to fight perchance	15.1597
confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	31.4513
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton  ah sir	31.5691
athos who heard miladys voice came sharply up	36.0955
section 1 general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic works   1a	1.6972
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv	8.1057
if i take you you will be hung  the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud	29.2050
it was there he must dig	23.2291
yes but he has been avenged	23.0584
but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation  and have your notions changed asked dants with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me  no neither do i wish to incur guilt	88.8065
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped	135.6427
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road	78.0958
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions	32.8001
a thousand francs  but whence have you obtained them  listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her	73.6956
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you	35.8313
you will find good cigars on the centre table	33.6317
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husbands inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter  madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door	29.9302
i have told you my wish or rather my determination	22.1721
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans eyes	12.5315

that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress  meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau	34.7720
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	17.3546
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder	22.1989
where and how  thats true  fore gad these frenchmen have no consideration  i had forgotten that england was an island and that you were the king of it  go to the riverside ask for the brig sund and give this letter to the captain he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen  the name of that port  st	542.3354
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	29.0975
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king	22.9757
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials	26.9119
but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently or so boldly the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes news on the spot entrance at all hours into kittys chamber which was contiguous to her mistresss	94.1546
at once dants resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again	42.3467
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton	25.4835
this morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of repose	50.9167
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard	13.6962
what are you doing cried kitty	14.3759
but im his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket  and he drew out the handkerchief	105.7390
you know what it is to love my lord	21.7079
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude  and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	51.5778
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity	39.9368
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me  50155m    well be it so	23.1195
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london	24.9010
do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you watch everything hear everything interpret everything  oh chevalier cried the king what can i say to you	38.3938
i come from the cardinal said the officer	24.5305
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing	31.9286
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows	45.4082
you understandno more delay  yes sir i will give my attention to the subject  i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	50.5784
the host shook his head	20.6237
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities  do not overwhelm me with happiness cried dartagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him	49.6621
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	53.9331
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness	38.6898
one day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone	18.2621
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat	22.7984
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the peoples good will	68.2647
it appeared to me  such women as i never weep said milady	47.0542
stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves  with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night	49.8107
he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face	36.4274
albert entered	43.7142
no time was to be lost	46.8038
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated chteau renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other	48.7062
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms	20.2333
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master	219.1199
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses	49.3317
dants had entered the chteau dif with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past	51.9015
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	364.3022
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint mran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep	36.9454

oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer	35.2860
dartagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where dartagnan had disappeared	73.7440
but you need not fear	57.3693
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy	36.8477
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions	36.0596
25 the other in the rue de la harpe no	5.8689

we are about to ascertain sire replied dartagnan as he rapidly left the room	23.1609
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good bye mercdswe shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas	57.2490
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine  willingly said albert but let us walk	62.4797
the pretty mme	295.7682
now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon  capital exclaimed albert your breakfast shall be waiting  where do you live  no	72.7389
why did not the countess the proud mercds the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour  ah baron baron said albert you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac like you  oh dont worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said  but will you undertake to speak to the father  willingly if you wish it  but let it be done explicitly and positively	438.5499
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinals	40.8023
oh misery oh vanity  you take it however  yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works  his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle	64.9514
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	17.0130
yes monseigneur said dartagnan	10.2812
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you  and you have me my lord	38.9386
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance	55.3261
precautions	30.2941
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone	11.3364
order of the king i tell you	18.3223
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue	33.0141
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	20.8493
good god added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that	19.9488
hem replied dartagnan	7.1603
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them  he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret	232.5400
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	49.6967
i shall be at vendin to place it in position	34.1214
well how is he now asked he	39.9214
athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee	19.1711
the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the box door	37.5880
come come calm yourself my sweet girl	16.1523
dartagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen	17.6540
m de morcerf will accompany me  bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six oclock	15.1153
and you are happy he said to his friend	34.9200
look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of athoss horse	20.9695
really captain groslow you are too much in fortunes way	16.9184
what had taken place during this long sleep	68.9711
pardieu said he here is a strange thing	11.3330
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another	23.7259
carriages now arrived in crowds those of the marechal de villeroy guitant villequier and comminges came into the line	15.2368
you have only to wait here till i release you  dartagnan was known to this valet de chambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal	33.2251
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock	34.1670
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	22.9587
you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	19.4196
porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this sword	30.3218
oh i am very presuming i am aware	11.5775
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i believed	39.2430
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps	24.0119
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies	58.9113
this operation proved as great a success as the first	51.1260
one went to support dartagnan the other porthos	126.3526
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes	63.0704
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	17.8257
and why so asked porthos warmly	30.9095
dartagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them	30.8726
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the childhe might become acquainted with your personnay he might even then have known it	244.3888
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton	58.6007
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment  nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded	39.4016
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	67.2556
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it	62.8026
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared  the scoundrel said aramis	23.2353
it was ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in person	24.5648
the count advanced to meet him	13.3740
you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks	21.1915
my mother was a christian and she prayed	26.7841
well all that was useless	127.9545
my father and m danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m danglars in the commissariat department	37.1316
let us sell the diamond	22.3315
has the corsican ogre broken loose cried a third	18.5824
my god said she what a senseless fanatic	26.9441
what oclock is it  the baron drew out his watch	46.6644
poisons act particularly on some organ or anotherone on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines	16.7012
cheer up said she to noirtier	38.5908
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings	13.8021
i know what is become of vasiliki and hayde	27.5933
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model	82.0887
at ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day	28.1296
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning	36.1482
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes	10.2849

what have you done with monsieur de bruy	14.2672
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	35.3873
when your turn comes i shall have the honor to inform you of it	18.7939
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy hayde smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	23.9116
i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling  remorse	24.2442
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature	16.1960
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn	26.7310
3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready	22.6634
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys visits	79.7509
i quit the world then i make a sacrifice	57.6763
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself	51.6533
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile	103.3959
he rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack	29.6021
the vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again	98.1127
no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond	24.0547
you see i am dying  dartagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her	23.3835
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	21.1197
i cannot be mistaken there are your horses	38.9599
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything	17.0122
i am not going there to be imprisoned said dants it is only used for political prisoners	37.6440
anne of austria returned to her oratory furious	9.1401
your excellency has not stated the number of guests  ah true  how many covers  count for yourself  is everyone here your excellency  yes  bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	59.2316
the two serving men waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances	24.3030
is it my fortune which you find insufficient	28.0049
you have befouled the face of your king	31.2675
at the outer door the steward paused	34.2283
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france  he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection  how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect	57.1990
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud  i have brought you another said dartagnan	46.5829
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body  milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning	98.3687
but dartagnan had now slipped through the window	27.2832
then there is his son andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his fathers millions	71.4096
albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult	52.0127
depend upon it i know what i say	12.2440
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majestys wishes will be complied with  do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will commence  the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room	30.9278
we must proceed in an orderly manner  hush said grimaud he is coming out	11.3542
dartagnan i am ready to follow you  and i also said porthos	15.6495
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him	20.5928
in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked  andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm	62.3710
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	25.2014
three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to svres	28.6764
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	16.7266
aramis porthos and dartagnan drew their chairs near him	29.9516
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me  cardinal  heavens	20.3729
chapter i the shade of cardinal richelieu	70.4417
m de trville received him as if he had seen him that same morning only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post	31.5697
since my convalescence i have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that i am forced to regulate them a little	24.4676
what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in words	53.0920
a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder	37.8814
two hours passed thus madame de saint mran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	18.0709
i imitate neither manfred nor anthony but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing soi repeat it you are right but in losing you i lose my life	289.7567
i know no better means than to act with candor	31.6094
well cried porthos	32.5072
coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband	47.5865
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled	19.8590
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m de trville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen	57.5566
mr	84.8631
we were once four valiant knightsfour hearts fondly united let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes	20.5397
let us be on our guard  oh	17.6011
well i know of ten such men  mazarin made no reply he reflected	61.5023
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll	48.7394
he turned round it was danglars	62.5687
what interest have they in your death	143.1910
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart	31.2429
he took her for the queen said dartagnan	37.3034
one may be very comfortable in a convent and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated i promise you on my part  good cried athos good	17.8487
i suffered that is all  yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	47.0631
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect	88.7058
attention porthos cried dartagnan	37.3235
remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish	32.4343
why of downright starvation  starvation exclaimed the abb springing from his seat	10.1040
he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sub lieutenant of the 53rd of the line	33.8340
alas he said i am then to die	21.1310
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen	17.3524
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself	124.9939
the handle of this saucepan was of iron dants would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it	28.1875
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late	16.8681
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	26.9527
at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl	15.2971
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet	32.8179
i dragged myself as far as the yard	32.9444
i will not make a confidant of him  alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain	17.4748
bertuccio remained standing before him	11.3619
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here  an enemy cried mercds with an angry look at her cousin	44.3680
it was only poisoned to the abb adelmonte	22.4388
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	60.3840
his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency	108.8437
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs  a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings	44.8512
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and dartagnan	23.6255
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming	57.4600
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	62.2268
the prisoners first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure airfor air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la rserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball	265.0606
as to dartagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate	96.4092
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100000 francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in parisamongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just nowit was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place	161.1358
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected	41.8981
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards	23.6844
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped	15.7866
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the mans footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room	41.3249
that is the crime of which i accuse her that is the cause for which she was branded  monsieur dartagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman  the punishment of death replied dartagnan	31.1779
blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m de villefort villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed it	41.8246
50077m    it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by valentine during the minute and a half madame de villefort remained in the room	21.2074
then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all	30.6430
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply  the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense	25.8607
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there	10.8935
it is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that  at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	35.6547
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame	50.0589
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family	47.3980
he was not long in making his toilet	39.6044
and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged  do you think so  i am sure of it  then i would kill him rather than let him go  and you would act rightly	86.2899
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could	23.0843
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead	22.7323
but his majesty has judges and these judges will decide  that is best said the king	46.3398
the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood	31.8055
fatality	66.9246
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry	21.4500
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you	33.9914
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord  as we have before said the post chaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration	168.1757
perceiving m de trville at a distance  come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you	33.8917
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc dangoulme by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of r where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la pre as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	80.2785
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient  bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket	90.6421
come this is no longer our home  the words died away the steps were lost in the distance	44.5166
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a cockbill the jib boom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot	533.7537
you cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger	25.4649
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried milady and a threatening glance darted from her eyes	24.2843
i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself  you could do no such thing fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i cannot give you more  well i will do better mercds	486.4828
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity	64.1012
the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sirthat relatively to what i have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn  but with what motive have you learned all this inquired villefort in astonishment	1154.9240

in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse  but he will not wish for only one harness  stake both pardieu i am not selfish as you are  you would do so said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself	190.9467

good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him	67.1236
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions	31.6857
madame more hopeless than he thinks	20.0455
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	48.8977
dartagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read  dec	20.2243

during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators	45.5740

spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence	16.5689
as to that no replied athos laughing	42.2779
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful	52.8377
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived  monsieur you insult the majesty of justice  not at all said athos calmly	45.2431
it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle that is to say at the other end of france	36.1337
after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared	12.1372
with me you will be as safe as in a temple i give you my word of a gentleman  let us go said she i place full confidence in you my friend  dartagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered dartagnans chambers	57.1025
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road	60.2488
it was noirtier the lemonade was intended forit is noirtier logically speaking who drank it	22.8782
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	19.5122
dartagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul	24.5647
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he	44.4651
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows  gentlemen	37.3411
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his heart	33.6820
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open	34.8864

i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it  and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs	34.7274
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	42.6120
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper	901.5459
this mystery required an explanation at least so dartagnan declared to himself	33.4928
one day as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre he was coming out as she was going in and she showed him to me  the devil	34.0044
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth  but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen	98.1971

athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	19.3316
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me	37.0712
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture	34.9838
the procurators wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived	53.4297

you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care  dartagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding four men and an escort a carriage and a horse five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard	56.6616
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose  the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners	71.4005
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	23.8988
my lords answered he it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me	143.3883
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux  thats true	22.7542

i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own	16.8599
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome  the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever  and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur dartagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place  do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy	356.2199
then said athos	23.3356
then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks	25.4122
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	35.4760
so dartagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarins  nor you of the prince de cond  no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists  adieu then and dartagnan poured out a glass of wine	74.9977
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said  you are monsieur dartagnan  i am that individual replied the officer	48.2687

it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken	23.2146
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words	22.5165
justify yourself if you can	7.5992
you will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine	32.0718
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal	46.2380
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his eye was calm and even brilliant	36.1214
athos invited dartagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve	85.2911
they stamped upon the carpet with their feet they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might	40.3164
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared	13.1374
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one partyi am for fresh air	24.9852
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at all  hein said dartagnan can she have charged you to tell me so  oh no monsieur but out of the regard i have for you i have taken the resolution to tell you so  much obliged my dear kitty but for the intention onlyfor the information you must agree is not likely to be at all agreeable  that is to say you dont believe what i have told you is it not so  we have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self love  then you dont believe me  i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance  what do you think of this  kitty drew a little note from her bosom	178.7535
to my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions	63.5905
where is providence  my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal him  my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart	38.0836

mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	50.0653

however scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there louis xviiis half filled snuff boxscarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	166.7552
there came in moreover two drafts which m morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted	28.7867
up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury	78.9803
you know about it  was i not your second cried dartagnan	43.5546
everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse	45.3235

he left the saucepan	47.7014

he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance	61.3574
at the same moment whilst dartagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase	51.9181
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper	16.7452
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger	12.1371
speak  madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart	21.7337
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when monsieur dartagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of la rochelle under the deceased cardinal and monsieur de bassompierre	70.4547
how happy you are in being exempt from all this  well and why should not you be free too	25.9910
it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercds sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	111.8353
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony	32.1186
i must die  then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame	38.0767
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercds and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them	36.7948
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed  unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke  this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects  oh my lord my lord  that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public  but your honor will soon be called so generally  i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	381.4451
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme	61.3622
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons	29.1901
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep  yes sire said aramis yes you are right	44.2255

i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 francs	9.6167
what tenderness my sister  but am i not your nearest relative demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness	27.5132
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour  to tell you that you are free your excellency  my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleons maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life	27.7468
the festa was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the garden walks	127.7061
27 said the inspector	10.1598
we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838  in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders  they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue  come come that is not bad said lucien	80.9405
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	89.0015
and now i am a frondeurnot of broussels party nor of blancmesnils nor am i with viole but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and delbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers	21.3347
chapter xix	121.8207
shall you never leave me again	45.2435
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul  you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible  you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say	58.4954
why then have you laid it aside  because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners  sir replied dartagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks	86.4807
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee	93.4745
chapter lxxxvi	189.8083
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	15.7265
what is he waiting for	11.1444
their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived	46.1300
i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed	37.4991
i warn you however his services will cost you something	75.2417
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti  the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same thingsindeed he heard nothing else	97.6852
theres a providence that watches over the deserving	11.0068
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much	81.2499
scarcely however had he touched edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house	62.8132
well said the count what are you doing  you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do  what may that be  we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them  do not concern yourself about that we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there  after the execution cried franz	37.2099
perfectly well quite rested sir  you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth	83.8006
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting  these words redoubled the eagerness of dartagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace	63.4558
he fancied that they buried the dead at the chteau dif and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the chteau frustrated his projects	78.0364
he labored and toiled until he had amassed 250000 francs six years sufficed to achieve this object	12.5475
i will answer for it said bonacieux	22.9171
she thinks of me then after five years of separation	29.1916
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	56.1091
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing  ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syriewe will not go alone to the garden  then said mercds i will lead the way  turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm  the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercds	132.8721
madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants	17.7830
well everything was finished as you know	97.0627
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back	29.3329
bonacieux	43.1529
if you had only to deal with four men dartagnan i would allow you to go alone	32.6630
the room was neatly comfortably furnished	15.4409
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and mannersa freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	722.6851
it was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	13.4986
until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abb the accusation of madness	28.8849
paternal affection	2.0840
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow	22.4915
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape	20.4273
peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales	28.7035

as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous	9.6407
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white	42.7144
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	70.9757
are you satisfied  well said felton till tonight  and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldiers half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place	34.7672
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered	18.8514
well are you going away in that manner	29.7564
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dants and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner  rapid as had been villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	118.0789
i was only speaking in reference to the second rate fortunes we were mentioning just now  and with all this how unassuming he is	22.9515
alas	57.8748

without me you would both have died	141.8399

an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor	48.2674
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba  i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand  then did you see him edmond  who  the marshal  yes  morrel looked around him and then drawing dants on one side he said suddenly  and how is the emperor  very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him  you saw the emperor then  he entered the marshals apartment while i was there  and you spoke to him  why it was he who spoke to me sir said dants with a smile	29.4317
what are you thinking of asked the abb smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder	11.2794
there must be plenty left replied dartagnan	37.9059
he was charged to tell the comte de la fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations	35.7691

oh i have done well	24.2862
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	193.0175
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse	22.2685
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard	15.3521

at first the captain had received dants on board with a certain degree of distrust	32.2828
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either  20323m    alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life	106.9329

the interior of the musketeers   when dartagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress	89.9012

when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching	50.0116
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful	36.0650
he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death	34.2176
mousqueton collected a store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones	200.6873

on the day after the morrow by eleven oclock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was	36.3327

blaisois went with him	49.8691

grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure	52.5236
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	52.2478
my friend said andrea i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me	13.5761
suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen	38.9048
see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count	29.1615
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dants had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	162.5922
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting  father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques  no	35.3240
suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a well known voice behind him exclaimed fatherdear father  the old man uttered a cry and turned round then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and trembling	64.3787
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations	42.0624
no but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing	60.6531
that is my name said athos quietly	21.3993
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style  i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers energy  what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are	297.6081
i have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer  oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempttry me once more  i will said the count	28.4780
did your excellency desire to see me inquired he	25.1862
once in paris i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman  well you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis	44.1304
dartagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were fired	40.3657
be reasonable	492.5016
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dants was stigmatized as a crime	136.8466
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us  meantime here we are enemies said porthos	46.0897
for example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond st petersburg the other five leagues from naples	35.2437
i speak to you in french said dartagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language	23.0488
believe meguilty as i wasoh yes i too have suffered much  have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon  no interrupted mercds but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son  mercds uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain a sob	327.4860
i must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water  hope my friend repeated the count	51.9334
you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can you  no i really cannot  well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter  but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire  ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it	119.6262
he had now leisure to look to his wound	22.7095
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues	50.5501
will he be at home at eight oclock this evening  doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out  i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired	44.8924
the notary bowed	152.1375
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	32.6169
hallo dants	20.1685
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it and that is why on account of the living mercds and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand andi have revenged myself  and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that  i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali	131.0786
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace	130.9250
bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue	55.5379
i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years  and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye	35.4254
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos	41.8613
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg   1e1	3.4025
come in said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately beauchamp appeared	36.5580
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb	31.5148
there are ten men to accompany you	27.0164
and cannot women be dishonored by appearances	92.3278
if im not mistaken heres bazin	87.6999
impossible	16.4912
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house  so that since that time replied dartagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host	148.6326
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men	38.2449
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches  ah	26.9459
yes the enemy	122.4199
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne	15.2399
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune  oh that depends upon circumstances	51.2297
dartagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	92.5730
your turn my lord said athos	15.8291
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it	21.2464
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities  at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man	156.3746
at what time you please sir replied franz	33.0838
dont you agree with me aramis  entirely my dear count	45.0966
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon	26.0963
well said porthos	8.2650
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog  i like the means well enough said dartagnan but where and how to meet with her  time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man	66.0296
but as m de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action	64.5308
he was carried home in the arms of the people	17.0215
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt	65.9051
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself	26.9864
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill	30.7795
i shall follow the counts directions  not under present circumstances monsieur  perhaps you mean to disobey me  yes monsieur i must  you persist then  yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out	114.3034
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud  very well let us say no more about it	19.3347
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers	20.6658
they arrived at ablain without accident	10.7274
she is very amiable then is she not said albert	34.0895
the carriage rolled rapidly onward	18.3989
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy	58.7700
emmanueljuliefarewell  how farewell exclaimed julie do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport  needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite at least i advised him to do so  i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner	149.4412
let us to bed  and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by dartagnan	31.2110
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed they have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal eagerly	154.4509
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wifes chamber and found dartagnan just recovering his senses	18.6877
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind	65.0952
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me  you may  shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	62.2590
she belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier	48.9800
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag	30.0166
bonacieuxs	95.5037
what can he want with me  he wishes to speak to you  to me  yes  did he mention my name  yes  what sort of person is he  why sir a man of about fifty  short or tall  about your own height sir  dark or fair  darkvery dark with black eyes black hair black eyebrows  and how dressed asked villefort quickly	36.1667
someone is coming	38.6184
a hundred pistoles	21.8838
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill  the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability	170.3264
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos	28.9331
everything conspired to prove to dartagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened	21.9637
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman	39.3544
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you  dartagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	200.9247
no no but wounded without doubt killed perhaps	108.4736
i have distrusted god i could the more easily distrust you	29.3543
i will take him dead thats all  a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	106.0443
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker	26.8390
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion	21.8876
at last they lost sight of each other	13.4520
by reading or using any part of this project gutenberg electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property trademarkcopyright agreement	16.3901
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment  still my lord i cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i cant travel on my savings for in my twenty two years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts  mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to dartagnan  take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey  if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought dartagnan we shall yet be able to do business together he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	161.2734
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	74.1572
sinbad the sailor   humph said the major very good	7.5499
the tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop	28.1469
come said dartagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you  and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match	25.3907
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously	31.9336
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms  and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice	52.8664
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself	53.3287
then dartagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not succeed	19.3771
you have assassinated a woman then cried the monk	45.9207
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street	11.4520
soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with gold	22.8501
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas	20.3559
by aramis is meant simara which is the name of a demon	21.7705
seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to france after a few years	9.3552
well	45.7819
to the boats my lads as quick as you can now continued penelon you see m morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get alongsave yourselves we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it	235.3372
i was about to become an abb and all was arranged	28.1797
the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand	42.1659
was not farias fate the better after allto solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering	23.2290
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion	42.5307
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine  danglars bit his lips	106.4012
is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short	8.9746
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever dartagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect	47.4613
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	31.3131
perhaps some accident has happened to him  i will hasten replied franz	23.8506
here i am  wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us  why all these precautions  you shall know  milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	74.8878
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her dartagnan would have returned home since he had so promised	46.5231
nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself	27.1809
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves  occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin	65.8111
let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france	33.8153
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people	25.4958
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him	40.9620
gumen was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts	63.2300
go he said go my child edward ran out	67.6937
no indeed cried dartagnan	45.2401
i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion  and of what did he die asked caderousse in a choking voice	28.1149
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	33.1472
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra	147.3688
and here is andrea cavalcantis baptismal register given by the cur of saravezza  all quite correct  take these documents then they do not concern me	12.8659
chapter xliii	89.7164

oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of davrigny	18.6112
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto	60.0308
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	175.1006
pooh replied dartagnan	7.5101
i must tell you resumed mazarin that it is in a double envelope  i understand and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place  just so take it and go	31.7510
the popular banker found that it answered better than count	149.4124
the usher returned and made a sign to dartagnan to follow him	12.8667
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	31.6943
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god	31.4536
poor queen already fallen	168.5587
if she flies kill her but dont exceed your orders  an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning	62.7604
that is lucky said blaisois	37.3289
an h and an n surmounted by a barons coronet  by heaven m bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms where did you study heraldry  in your service excellency where everything is learned  go on i am curious to know two things  what are they your excellency  what became of this little boy	35.7554
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	16.3058
in the first instance to marseilles madame  to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	48.3223
and a little bit of a thief  oh sir	53.8809
to a look of interrogation which they made milady replied by a sign that it was he	34.2000
the count de villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers  the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as henry iv	64.1283
what then  how much do you require for my ransom  merely the 5000000 you have about you danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart	48.9796
shall you be present in the reception room  no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office	22.6205
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you  the old man nodded	21.4380
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute a branded woman	26.1362
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion	41.0560
it came from my brother the king of spain	50.8490
there only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	116.7383
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk	89.9186
yes i am a man of honor said dartagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess itfor i do possess it do i not  entirely go on  well i feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my mind  a confession  if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not  without doubt  then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me  perhaps  dartagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to miladys but she evaded him	35.2990
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire	43.2422
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime  say absurd since it has become useless	21.4014
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	63.4476
m danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	32.7712
have you the money he demands  yes all but eight hundred piastres  the count went to his secrtaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself  you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz	98.6775
at last their hilarity calmed down and  faith exclaimed dartagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin for i assure you on his side he wishes you no good  pooh	150.6653
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation	23.6381
grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself	24.4391
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither	52.0998
your hand dants	323.8965
it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad	43.3512
i cannot explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them	51.3573
have you lost it asked blaisois	23.1952
a nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when valentine was asleep	36.2841
parry who accompanied him stood behind him	34.1124
that is my condemnation thought dartagnan he will spare me the ennui of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial	19.9600
must we then asked anne of austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times  mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal seriously	56.7918
who the beggar was that i killed  ah	97.5476
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and delbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours  we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have	35.5629
is he alive and at liberty	68.5906
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives	17.7439
there he cried	63.5353
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or faceit is not your fault	18.9512
what an appetite you used to have	31.0328
monte cristo shuddered and arose	18.7038
i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misfortune i attach myself to it	45.8500
the scaffold will be ready by to morrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow  what then said the king	58.7797
justice before everything  then turning toward m de trville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window well monsieur continued he you say it is his eminences guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers  yes sire as they always do  and how did the thing happen	54.5624
he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair	64.7562
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy	96.0468
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass	40.8326
nobody knows you	5.8740
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned	188.7129
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure	62.4866
but i am grateful i swear to you  but what does this note contain  milady will tell you  ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched  to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women	36.7826
well cried milady in a sharp voice	22.2922
happily i vanquished death	19.2736
no and yet they refused to buy it  why said chteau renaud	38.5205
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	24.3745
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion	45.8089
all hands to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in	31.4617

this vexes you said athos	21.6149
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking manan arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or otherat a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape	794.2999

at that moment the door opened	6.0682
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles	22.8029
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot	16.6902
follow him said villefort to dants	47.9672
left alone dartagnan read and reread his billet	14.0887
certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain	168.6586
the day on which dartagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province	46.2038

athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance	58.2493

where are you going  oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	35.0596
all at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone	17.9456
oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself i should run mad	51.4342
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	12.7942
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace	7.3264
aramis cried athos dont fire  ah	81.9874
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air	32.5997
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor	25.1918
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately	36.5759

what has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune	22.1046
to undermine the ground for fifty feetto devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the seato plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shorewere difficulties so startling and formidable that dants had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death	1656.7853
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently  so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed  have you no letter for him asked the young man	91.6432

nonsense let us break open the door and if he is too far gone in his madness well we will kill him  softly gentlemen said dartagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you please  good good cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these devourers of little children and we shall see  brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly	80.8883
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis	42.1219
i wrote to franzand were he here he would confirm every wordi wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word  but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said chteau renaud	668.0035

this cant last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	64.5956

great people only thank you for doing the impossible whats possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right	67.4070
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous	41.5457
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled	35.9212

oh as for that ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horses bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him	62.0076
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers	50.0659
go  morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire	96.4133
dants reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	108.6658
yes	32.9558
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber	20.2683

this is all very strange said m de trville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud  yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence but why should i have done otherwise	32.3832
and how do you know it asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart	19.7959
what do you mean beauchamp  oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the ministers said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain	38.5334
and no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs	52.9756
edmond resigned the lugger to the masters care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment	67.6684
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart	15.3312
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean	50.2895

dear maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line  o mathilde	26.4907
the young mans eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie	9.6660
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him	24.8966
when i am dead you will go and examine it  what said morrel you dead  yes must i not be prepared for everything dear friend	49.1278

god has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	39.6519
dants half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent	67.0794
embrace porthos from aramis and myself	129.9638
then some words were spoken by the two women	49.9264
now my young friend said he england is all our own	37.7657
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows	49.0216
at the sight of the little letter the heart of dartagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	41.1559
how are you to get away from here	40.5853
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him	26.9054
death to the guards	66.8748
then as i believed my husband would be at home i hastened hither  to place yourself under his protection  oh no poor dear man	29.8086

i am not obliged to read any breviary	26.3188

who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition  oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	128.8592
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt  ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt  my faith yes said dartagnan	125.2695
dartagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time	61.2905
he wasnay probably may still bea bonapartist and is called noirtier i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort	43.9143
i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question	25.2444
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner	14.4407

the president read  mr	113.7014
our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services  does he wear them  no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers  he is a quaker then  exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress  has he any friends  yes everyone who knows him is his friend  but has he any enemies  one only  what is his name  lord wilmore  where is he  he is in paris just now  can he give me any particulars  important ones he was in india with zaccone  do you know his abode  its somewhere in the chausse dantin but i know neither the street nor the number  30289m    are you at variance with the englishman  i love zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends  do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris  to that question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m cavalcanti to him  andrea  no bartolomeo his father  now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly  what is it sir  do you know with what design m de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil  certainly for he told me  what is it sir  to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo	307.8853
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse	58.4981
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread	68.5549
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble light	65.8295
oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days  monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation	119.7335
but still we have quite lost our dear eugnie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france  still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire	176.0542
it struck ten	192.3459
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	27.9317
she loves him devilishly he murmured	10.0805
well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris  i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections  but god forgive me cried anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her i believe that you are yourself interrogating  yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur dartagnan dartagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman	47.1997
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way	22.0784
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts	52.5408
never mind be content i will do my best	21.5898
why do you not realize a six months a years advance even and retire to brussels	50.2850
this is the order he said	31.2631
28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order	21.0473
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it  i shall never forget it replied dartagnan	46.1027
yield he cried or you are a dead man the musket fell from the soldiers hands who yielded on the instant	38.7404
the hour of dinner soon arrived	84.3026
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres	17.7796
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days	21.8025
taste some of this ham dartagnan it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young mans plate	22.1259
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir	52.0154
the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found dants leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light	45.4904
the cardinal put it on in military style	62.6162
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed	58.3558
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur asked monte cristo	22.3828
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight	32.0155
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time  thank you sir it will be well employed i hope  cromwell turned as he was going	43.1174
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de trville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	54.8925
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through fear	37.7534
one hundred thousand francs for a loaf  one hundred thousand francs repeated peppino	13.0841
the people have seen monsieur de cond a prince of the blood royal arrested by my mother in law maria de medicis they saw my mother in law their former regent expelled by the cardinal they saw monsieur de vendome that is to say the son of henry iv a prisoner at vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a brousselgood god	69.1418
oh my god cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell	16.4175
a barrier had been placed between dants and his old friend	51.5596
the general remark is oh it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as m villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters	91.3603
i say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret  which you will guard i hope young man as your life  but which i must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty  is this secret your own  no monsieur it is her majestys  are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to me  no monsieur for on the contrary i am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery  why then are you about to betray it to me  because as i said without you i can do nothing and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it  keep your secret young man and tell me what you wish  i wish you to obtain for me from monsieur dessessart leave of absence for fifteen days  when  this very night  you leave paris  i am going on a mission  may you tell me whither  to london  has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there  the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my success  and you are going alone  i am going alone  in that case you will not get beyond bondy	98.8023
queer though	3.2485
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at dartagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship	24.3389
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	30.7155
athos made him a sign to come with them	17.9186
the cavalcade trotted on more sharply	31.3818
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday  indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment	58.5697
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations	187.5428
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation	55.3189
by the latter i mean your relatives and friends	57.0728
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	67.3576
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires	52.7777
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger  that is well understood  and in that case how shall i know where you are  you do not want your lackey  is he a sure man  to the proof  give him to me	50.1042
albert in his turn sat behind	33.1805

planchet  planchet added grimaud planchet with a gorget indeed  ah gentlemen cried planchet so you are back again in paris	50.3020
dartagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brilliants	22.7111
dants seemed full of kindness	43.7645
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dants paused with anguish on his brow	23.8870
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person	244.8404
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads  rochefort and dartagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye	44.6940
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper	19.8674

there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say furtherthe art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance  but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land	142.2437

i know a clever person at tours  aramis stopped on seeing athos smile	94.0472
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the alles de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	272.6854

oh lackadaisy	208.7917
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoi give you back your promise  it is well said dants	32.9768
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans	41.4065

the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back	17.2299
powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget28 the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebire	147.7350
bah cried porthos	9.4636
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart	13.6110
as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg	76.8052
in the meantime follow me  the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did likewise	30.3402

supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say  well  supposing the assertion to be really true  a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor  ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit  that is precisely the fault of the age  and do you undertake to reform it  yes as far as i am personally concerned  well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow  yes i own it  are you quite impervious to good advice  not when it comes from a friend  and do you account me that title  certainly i do  well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject  from whom  from hayde  why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it  she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to  i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition  you reject this means of information then  i domost decidedly  then let me offer one more word of advice  do so then but let it be the last  you do not wish to hear it perhaps  on the contrary i request it  do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchampvisit him alone  that would be contrary to all custom  your case is not an ordinary one  and what is your reason for advising me to go alone  because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp  explain yourself  i will do so	96.0495
a good mother cannot depart without her son  villefort could not believe his eyeshe could not believe his reason he dragged himself towards the childs body and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub	69.7627

there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts	31.7164
the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead  that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses  you see i travel with them  but you are not always travelling  when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale  but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them  then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects  count may i suggest one idea to you  certainly  it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe  you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession  then he must be a wonder	143.6140

am i deceived	80.1023
the notary she exclaimed let him come in  the notary who was at the door immediately entered	39.1044
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	85.7416
i ask pardon of your eminence said dartagnan but i was so fatigued  dont ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service  dartagnan admired mazarins gracious manner	41.9906
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	24.6218
the count understood him	42.3221
pardon cried felton oh pardon  milady read in his eyes love	129.6976
you cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other  if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement	36.5296
taste the hashish guest of minetaste the hashish  franzs only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth	60.1329
you are crazy	39.5017
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse	65.7749
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery	77.7188

my lordescape	734.8004
no my daughter is not guilty	44.5757
all at once he uttered a terrible cry	17.0409
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill  the monster was himself	63.5923
but said andrea ill temperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you  my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating	52.4719
yes for an instant i hoped it was so	32.8829
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose  but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place  he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter	191.3421
what a disgrace to us  oh never fear	63.7509
madame said villefort i ask where is m davrigny	47.5624
ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have it  good god cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear dartagnan i think  yes cried dartagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my friend  ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers  the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires	104.4351

i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops  thats well said monte cristo i remain here a day or twoarrange accordingly  as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter	54.2373
all very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist	31.0818
athos killed his adversary first	102.7285
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me	40.0403
in what a tone you speak cried valentine	58.1069
all the crowd gave way before morrel	45.5900
at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived he had seen chteau renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised	32.5246
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan	83.5843
i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration  nothing more simple returned the count	60.8099
dartagnan was worn out with fatigue	28.0432
yes said the king but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men  sire i am here said dartagnan and i give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it  and now what is to be done asked the queen for i hear them  monsieur laporte go to them and again recommend silence	23.8962
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill	40.1486
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office	25.2195
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony  sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved methat i have given nothing to that gallant officer dartagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond  as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	83.0298
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin long live broussel long live blancmesnil resounded through the city	137.1819
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels	16.4430
she was charming	50.0281
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath	20.0750
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villeforts we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts	79.8239
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good  i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	39.5962
it was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern	30.8882
the house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics	25.8913
the young man pressed valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase	17.8830
the four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them	13.0130
he will be condemned will he not asked debray of beauchamp	66.5595
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos	64.0557
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots	165.0250
a little farthera little farther said the other	8.1282
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors	45.4753
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him	20.2282
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these	25.1395
on reaching home dartagnan found kitty waiting for him	26.7020
five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes door	13.9452
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance  two soldiers said dartagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window  that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out  fine looking men upon my word said dartagnan	117.3236
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time	25.3242
only grazed a little replied dartagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was broken  that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully	68.1807
dartagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter	15.4724
yes ali himself my nubian mute whom you saw i think at rome  certainly said morcerf i recollect him perfectly	77.5778
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance	21.7194
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes	8.1522
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	16.0012
who wants me  a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal  and who wishes to speak with me  who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne  then let him come in if you please  oh my god my god cried mme	40.2079
albert listened with the most profound attention	13.3692
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise	17.6398
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room	22.1654
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side  good thought dartagnan in this direction i am satisfied he pressed aramiss hand and went in search of porthos	62.3491
it signifies nothing whether you eat much or littlewhether you have ten dishes or oneit is always the same price  what still keeping up this silly jest	54.7577
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor	30.2546
what you tell me is horrible sir	46.2299
say to her peace or war	129.9850
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge	13.3201
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive meyes or no  saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans	49.3335
in the meantime dartagnan was defiling with his company	14.6533
when they arrived at the madeleine  since we are out said beauchamp let us call on m de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters  gladly said albert let us calli love him     chapter 85 the journey  monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together	53.5520
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts	17.8192
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession  then said the count i refer you to your confessor	48.3116
yes undoubtedly the abb busoni himself replied monte cristo	20.1967
but this unexpected unhoped for unheard of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and howby a murder	32.7458
thats not fair said the seaman who had saved dants for you know more than we do  what is that to you jacopo returned the captain	74.2330
courage	10.4994
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death  it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton	27.9405
he could not understand how alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation	13.9009
if his heart is free and he will marry hayde the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish	55.3636
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	119.7235
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions	37.0855
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia	11.0219
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him	14.2566
what are my commands said the queen	15.4872
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story  what else have you done  after having lost my own horse nine against tensee how neari formed an idea of staking yours  yes but you stopped at the idea i hope  no for i put it in execution that very minute  and the consequence said dartagnan in great anxiety	176.9270
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	37.3872
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation	105.1311
to think of the parisians soliloquized dartagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or aliveif alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial  come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs	256.7852
she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies	30.5862
consider monsieur the thing is absolutely impossible  monsieur bonacieux said the commissary looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts you have a wife  yes monsieur replied the mercer in a tremble feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing that is to say i had one  what you had one	101.3885
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger	32.2004
occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen	6.5624
the abb scarron	44.9368
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered	96.1273
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison	40.3989
really honest men are not so scarce as i thought  dont be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman	16.3557
athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so skillfully  no doubt	29.2501
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible but instead of listening m dpinay went onyou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one the president stopped the coach	34.7659
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror	52.9384
her son said he	24.9755
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed dartagnan aside with his hand	43.0156
they advanced towards a boat which a custom house officer held by a chain near the quay	39.0362
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet  and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior	41.4963
besides i care not for his displeasure  still situated as we are  yes do you know how we are situated	44.3486
a lady it was said had just fainted they had supplied her with a smelling bottle and she had recovered	45.3797
they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	35.7261
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege	25.8763
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain	46.1592
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	16.5064
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women  i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said dartagnan	62.1698
assuredly said davrigny	17.5785
branded in the eyes of the world you invoke try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad  then addressing the man who accompanied him executioner said he do your duty  oh his name his name cried felton	57.6560
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse	90.5475
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman  the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow voice	60.2419
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at estre sometimes at jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment	72.9108
speak i am ready to obey  no monsieur no i am not called louis the just without reason	43.5388
you believe so  i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time  well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you  your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them  that is unfortunate returned monte cristo	71.8680
franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert	39.9305
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	21.4436
but this planchet is so serious and important that i have not informed my friends that i would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission i would not write it  be satisfied monsieur said planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me  mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers but otherwise as light hearted as possible	76.1333
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves  oh my god cried mme	19.8372
for the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if porthos were still at the great st martin he would call for him on his way	41.0227
sir said dartagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side  no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers  well that is scarcely the question	36.1024
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred  it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting	124.8778
peste said dartagnan to porthos	11.5552
aramis he cried	34.9190
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure	27.9794
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her  trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	78.8531
he did so and thus doubled his income	43.1841
pray dont heed him sirhe only barks he never bites	5.8529
monte cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all	18.0366
if my mother could know of this attention on your partand i will venture to tell heri am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed	57.9413

come hayde come and throwing his arm around the young girls waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared	29.2871
his desire for revenge had not forsaken him	49.5102

go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you  although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior	196.9152
liked a pleasant jest	13.6776
the two men followed the company and on leaving the faubourg st antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them	16.6171
the kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism	28.1545
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else  they continued their route	29.0525
at this moment grimaud came in	13.3149
this lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us	36.8523
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake  noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	65.0071
if you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your wishes	34.6646
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii	20.1760
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide	41.3095
these important advantages dartagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe	21.4051
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	73.0419
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that  i am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of them	31.7842
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chestnow madame here are 800 notes of 1000 francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25000 francs then for the odd cash making i think about 110000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured  madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank notes	411.1192
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world	16.0328
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	69.4271
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful	17.3510
why do we love	58.1494
if dartagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is	73.1452
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	33.0479
keep watch from seven to nine	172.2672
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors	188.9728
thats my room replied groslow	78.9865
polish up or make some one else polish my arms	29.7521
linen and wine are both being warmed come  the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	33.0752
the pharaon	378.1038
this house is part of valentines marriage portion and m de saint mran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin  it was morrels turn to become pale	63.6369
as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone  be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds  20064m    and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hiding place and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted jacopo jacopo jacopo  then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies	99.1002
now guess what the young one did  tell me  he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body	90.8815
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	86.6791
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes	28.4456
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes	15.1516
besides repentance becomes the guilty whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god  guilty	34.5516
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	17.3700
the procureur went out after having double locked the door	26.4971
the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees	23.1240
after numberless windings dants saw a door with an iron wicket	18.0777
40050m    the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably	36.9783
but since you possess that virtue why the devil dont you make use of it with respect to her majesty	22.5378
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse	57.8829
the nails too were turning blue	267.1277
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me	49.3068
nonsense	66.9046
she took me away without speaking	58.9663
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it	33.5746
dartagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords	37.2128
to whom	109.8565
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base	52.4072
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	37.9435
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name	49.2624
dants told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one	30.0814
your eminence may believe added dartagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants  the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little	59.0730
i am mad for her  kitty breathed a second sigh	39.3493
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape	29.9911
oh	66.4446
come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine come i feel ill here and the two young men spurred on	45.0672
go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms	29.4338
well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause deathso pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars	129.6358
i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me	15.1080
the history of athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong	52.3636
so once more good night caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	50.5257
oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all	27.5885
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him  my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him	33.3011
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms	54.7902
look here resumed dartagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges  the devil said porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that  do you hear interrupted dartagnan become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the counts place in everything and he jingled his money	62.6066
au revoir not farewell	7.0999
from a distance they perceived aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like sister anne at the dust in the horizon	72.0880
i have had no occasion to notice him particularly hes an old acquaintance	20.9764
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine	27.2836
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke	44.3216
no aramis replied	117.4041
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while dartagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table	57.7762
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours  your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo  and who is beppo  oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle  indeed	41.6704
albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you  probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity	46.6169
albert was punctual	39.1394
well eugnie what is it you want with me	22.3428
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tongue tied	60.7327
a nightly patrol	14.8776
besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power	33.2153
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dants sank again into his seat	77.9596
the repast was magnificent monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests	34.6428
go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify	132.3126
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	84.1615
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning	69.1409
my dear dartagnan said aramis dont be too angry with me i beg	15.2361
dants easily recognized them faria had so often drawn them for him	43.3577
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum	56.3855
when he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks	28.5087
anne of austria took two steps forward	18.5118
it is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa  yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning	41.5149
i understand you or rather i am wrong	33.9588
bonacieuxhe ran full of joy to seek his comrades whom he had left only half an hour before but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied	31.6355
ah may you be a true prophet said dartagnan laughing	31.2105
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	14.3885
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	6.9163
well	16.3760
you perceive then that he is not happy said the count	29.8773
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada	102.9654
i see no one and yet the ladder didnt come down of itself  no it is bazin  ah	82.0019
but how can that be	23.2711
thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place  seven or eight leagues at the most	56.0347
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther	35.8844
you are setting up an establishment of course  why yes replied the count	20.2018
dartagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queens apartment	118.9735
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me  nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only i want it  julie made a pretence to feel for the key	55.7261
there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphiuss rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horacea work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch	232.5927
the count laid his hand on franzs shoulder	35.6384
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that  however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations	114.9440
he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector	36.8159
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes she then bowed to m noirtier and retired	42.6554
in one second athos joined him	61.8598
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child  it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven  and very soon they left the inn	27.8858
bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness	23.1848
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes	30.9089
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him	56.6810
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said hayde shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake	108.7885
i told you so said dartagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it  and you monsieur dartagnan what do you want  my lord said dartagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant  yes and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain  dartagnan bowed	45.6039
how go then exclaimed dartagnan	71.1748
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down	29.4296
i could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks	24.0337
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together	31.3646
in an instant dartagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes	52.0217
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint  it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head look at england madame  yes but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen	45.3907
porthoss chamber is you say on the first story number one  yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that i could have let ten times over  bah	59.5455
what a confounded country this england is	29.3630
franz thanked the count for his attention	32.6391
you see it makes a very respectable appearance  pardieu cried dartagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals money  you are an amiable and charming young man said mme	52.5669
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt	227.4423
you were right he said my dear monsieur dartagnan and you cannot set out yet	35.4141
oh good lord said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you	12.4159
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period	46.8130
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living  imbecile exclaimed la carconte	78.8733
this noise redoubled when dartagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church	48.1711
let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for i always understood you were a bachelor  that was the general opinion sir said the major and i  yes replied the count and you confirmed the report	69.5603
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation	48.1375
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest	83.2545
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger  what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host	27.2616
3 which he had occupied on his last stay at compigne	29.4091
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling	183.4841
eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st germain	7.6876
you see i am a good sort of a man  do not jest about holy things my friend  go on then i listen  i had been at the seminary from nine years old in three days i should have been twenty	35.0169
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying  here is the brazier lighted  there was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dants was listening in horror	424.9257
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	14.2328
porthos he exclaimed	52.1862
the queen entered and dartagnan remained at the door	24.5973
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment	25.8814
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything	20.3350
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse	128.5205
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one  its true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it  the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist	101.3442
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her	30.4350
monte cristo and hayde took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar	19.1873
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals  the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme	26.4984
ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon  good said dartagnan to himself	77.8192
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him	20.8835
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3000 francs  child sighed mercds	36.4083
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier	24.3277
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	20.1982
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it	20.1743
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	26.9593
oh whatever may be m noirtiers reason answered morrel i can readily believe it to be a good one  an excellent one said valentine	44.2713
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me	19.5892
but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading	52.1314
a hundred pistoles	21.8838
open the door  the captain obeyed	23.7675
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened  the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner  you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	57.9125
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	32.1002
what do you mean to do with that purse whispered he	10.6705
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret	59.4514
what think you of it inquired athos	54.2559
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good  it is so good that i have distanced m de chteau renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the ministers arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour  then they follow you asked monte cristo	104.2300
he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to la ramees heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination	37.1354
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table	23.2473
ah pardieu said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit  are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper	28.4347
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table  yes monsieur  that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it  deposited with the justice they said it was bad money  very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles  but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of	36.2840
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england	74.5833
then how do you hope valentine will escape  noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot	25.8484
m danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 francs	9.0210
go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman  it will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the englishman	43.4329
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship	83.7092
it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good  say not so quickly returned monte cristosay not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be	82.5873
neither dared for some time to speak in that room	20.5411
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to alis finger	11.4893
well my dear friend said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours	30.1090
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window one doesnt descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a lime tree and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac  aramis burst into a fit of laughter	73.5719
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him	42.7713
the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen	30.4276
what a proposition  i thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up  indeed said the receiver	33.5843
i am dying	24.2603
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen	30.1850
0111m    the boat continued her voyage	39.8398
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care  and what is her name  hayde replied monte cristo	32.8696
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard	58.2337
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat	39.3198
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see	56.7259
the count de guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by raoul who came to wish him good day	29.8457
mark well what i say	16.9389
monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of you  bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my conversation  bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went out	54.6291
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame  oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much  perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant  i shall borrow from the queen  but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	46.6239
alas he said to himself if i only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul	28.3546
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	45.7648
as to athos he remained unmoved	35.6531
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event  why replied he i think it just possible dants may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband  but how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since you are the ships supercargo  why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden	80.0517
bravo bravi brava the banker was enthusiastic in his applause	10.4401

an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door	8.5662
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest	32.7384
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man	27.3537
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man  this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage	204.9176
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy  her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	80.1863
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abb	58.0062
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornlie	35.0420
he therefore found dartagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with him	26.5197
bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his valet de chambre who was behind him what musketeers are now within the palace  the black musketeers my lord  what company  trvilles company  is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber  lieutenant dartagnan  a man on whom we can depend i hope  yes my lord  give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on  the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded	75.1752
you are not judges	25.1915
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same	23.3856
he would have writtenor  at this instant someone knocked at the door	9.1272
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded	21.4692
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife	28.0426
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes	13.4077
on then	897.3009
it was simply yet richly furnished	32.5220
the damp had rendered it friable and dants was able to break it offin small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed	119.5744
is she not free to love whomsoever she will  oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing	33.6723
m de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair	28.8355
if he troubles me too much i will crush him the insect	25.8454
the count had just opened a door	36.7886
be not alarmed at what i say i want to be convinced	24.9856
in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind	18.1783
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse  yes truly dear friend and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay  and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly	99.0159
the next day kitty went to see the young man again and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening	29.4432
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem  indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose	46.2751
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m noirtier and barrois partook	56.8966
what did your excellency say inquired the other	30.9741
betrayed	64.5766
an officer approached	44.8785
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave  how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster	26.8311
no madame if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it  really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne  are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied athos	49.1761
dartagnan turned to porthos	39.6448
all faithful hearts with me cried out winter	81.9334
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of planchet faded away	82.1569
let us return to my ring or rather to yours	27.6319
dartagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds	35.2212
now jump down athos  athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	21.8301
this famous invention of yours  must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first  yes thats the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily	98.4946
you really vilify me cried olivain	18.2100
no one could be seen or heard	49.8237
dartagnan was beside himself with joy	66.4727
by jove	92.4672
yes madame said dartagnan but get in fearlessly for i myself will drive you  the queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her side	36.4843
on	76.3498
the return also of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet	37.4416
memory makes the one philosophy the other  but cannot one learn philosophy  philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven  well then said dants what shall you teach me first	522.4801
are you sure that the other is dead  the other said athos in so stifled a voice that dartagnan scarcely heard him	30.5023
the real reason madame i can assure you i know my father  but i want to know in what way m dpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person  i believe i know m franz dpinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron dpinay by charles x  the same said villefort	47.3634
no cardinal said dartagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he  exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture	116.7647
pardon you monseigneur	55.3782
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder	55.5388
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself	80.4389
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes	57.3321
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way  ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldnt surprise me at all  perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us  nonsense	46.2451
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot	40.7372
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	36.6799
theres luck my lord	13.3450
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay	44.0283
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight	72.6224
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	139.9047
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good  but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs  ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are	106.2305
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fre  all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	92.8342
endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king	39.3040
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you  i am at your command my lord returned dartagnan	25.2290
dartagnan and i or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	64.5253
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late  the gale had given way	16.8981
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon	9.9688
for me	19.4344
sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m franz the old man gave no answer	14.5418
it is m franz de quesnel baron dpinay  while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old mans countenance	22.8912
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night	28.8447
they must be enemies  he is right said porthos battle	50.1632
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert	53.2271
you are about to become captain at nineteenan elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone  you are right you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them  you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you	113.0389
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate  possibly  and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action  it is not for me to judge	237.4313
he meditates	1208.4082
 you provide in accordance with paragraph 1f3 a full refund of         any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the         electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of         receipt of the work	61.0652
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room	59.2196
well said the queen it has been refused  the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	18.4471
he then seemed more easy	144.2429
it matters little now to me	42.8570
excuse my weakness	41.5490
it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement	44.7402
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither immediately	21.0740
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	30.0948
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother	9.7278
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form	3.8044
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed	367.8576
chapter 27 the story  first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise  what is that inquired the abb	25.0546
dants saw that he must attack the wedge	21.0826
it was fourteen years day for day since dants arrest	101.1239
dartagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch	47.4672
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy  oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this  then turning to dartagnan she said  sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received	35.8986
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	22.3633
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited	28.9950
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord	16.0842
who is this caderousse  some provenal it appears	64.4967
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrels breast	23.0513
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight	71.1424
no my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france  what do you think of all this said athos in a low tone to dartagnan after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english	109.0534
albert recognized the bearer	55.2619
well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu  admirable sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days  which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath  ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information	103.6247
you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous	17.9081
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	22.3883
act then as you think proper there is still time to withdraw  no monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and i will have confidence in you	49.8439
oh death is in my house cried villefort	51.5718
what the devil	10.1986
what said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom what	25.0477
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die	49.9045
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale	22.3512
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death  would you assassinate me sir	24.4230
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrels entrance it was again opened for the count	22.1213
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dants	33.9732
i have reflected and i cannot must not be guilty of such a sin  ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and i also have reflected  upon what  that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word  oh my god murmured felton	52.5523
you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty	46.5333
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended	24.1809
take it then but in exchange  caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand	41.3191
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	88.2245
well i will teach you how to behave yourself  and i will send you back to your mass book master abb	22.1810
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said	47.8500
you are welcome gentlemen she said	23.2286
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercds tremble	36.7370
do you know where i shall find him  near blois	15.4483
ah these musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be hanged  no sire replied trville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire ill be their warranty	89.7591
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier said she	32.3713
they disobeyed orders  i beg of your majesty then said athos calmly and not replying to mazarin to quash these arrests of messieurs dartagnan and du vallon  what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen	148.2841
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos he can he says only swim in rivers  when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere	77.2317
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends	61.1812
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right	22.9015
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing  we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos	59.7294
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentines room	24.9958
as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerfs antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the counts card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him	62.6054
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound	41.4067
deserted she repeated ah yes i am indeed deserted	64.0240
good god cried kitty there is my mistress calling me	27.5179
it would be a dishonor to all the nobility  fine sport by jove cried porthos with a laugh that shook the windows	30.3207
i like that	82.0083
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	155.5483
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes  he must have one said athos	43.2852
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that dartagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place	68.4057
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary	23.5789
de chevreuse was at tours	32.9476
ho there boy	14.0811
the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her fall	47.4200
i am mistaken  monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him  no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me	21.2578
has anyone brought a letter for me asked dartagnan eagerly	45.9343
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercds  you have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs  i said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i cant keep on my legs	71.6327
cond himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him	20.4302
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle	45.2655
see and she exposed her face completely to viewsee misfortune has silvered my hair my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my brow is wrinkled	111.5554
heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing  danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured	18.1998
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beatthe child was dead	41.2395
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man  did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there  ah truly	61.7116
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on	34.7038
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught	17.2970
no positively i will not go	26.0084
on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall  oh god he read preserve my memory  oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful	30.1568
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy  so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box	37.6659
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from dartagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone  porthos said dartagnan who will attend you in your campaigns  why replied porthos mouston of course  this was a blow to dartagnan	101.8791
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek  it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light  no valentine i assure you such is not the case	227.1936
do you not know these bits of paper  bank notes  exactly there are fifteen of them  and whose are they  yours if you like  mine exclaimed the man half suffocated	45.3707
it was in fact mordaunt whom dartagnan had followed without knowing it	45.2229
hallo fernand	2.4654
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools  your orders are very simple he said dont allow anybody except one person to enter here	62.8652
directly afterwards the moon rose	7.9413
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself	36.0416
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do  that is it replied the cardinal dryly	23.0148
well replied la ramee your supper is ordered  ah	65.8267
athos started	340.4801
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	52.7106
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	46.0982
aramis returned home and athos and dartagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire	14.1597
the ferry across the oise	8.2160
comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	15.9126
he wished to have the young man at handnot that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen	16.4504
do you not see how she suffers  hayde answered with a heartrending expression  why should he understand this my sister	17.5290
dartagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient	39.0125
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	40.6788
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor these were the beggars of the court of miraclesthe agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache preparing barricades for the morrow	101.5982
what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp sayshave i	30.8595
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk	48.1392
on approaching the house he perceived m bonacieux in morning costume standing at his threshold	85.6922
then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables	13.4039
the englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles	18.7696
i retained my harness by instinct	57.5419
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	7.5024
come said andrea you are a man void of compassion ill have you turned out  this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh	42.2316
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half hour	33.8094
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said  come gentlemensome coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn	35.8514
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea	37.1980
i thought i had told you a most lamentable story and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart	12.0331
well asked he	25.0635
no  she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty	72.6428
she corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the duke	26.1349
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell monsieur de trville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him	23.7895
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners	26.9505
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book	12.7923
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out	28.3542
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much noise	22.7097
he will answer you  the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor	26.3467
oh the train is well laid the plot is clever	93.2183
these gentlemen are with me said winter	62.4273
i pity her then  and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	67.1096
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back	22.4112
come do you really think you have anything to say against me	22.7963
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil	434.0355
that is useless  yes yes	32.0054
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said danglars but do not fear it	39.2286
0317m    when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him	51.9992
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger	32.9002
50025m    no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor	27.2974
dartagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau	13.2616
it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it	19.6731
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose	40.9750
i cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render	28.8696

those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle  dartagnan and porthos obeyed	118.1742
dants saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand	24.4850
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples  because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend	96.3452
dpinay said he allow me to remind you at this momentwhich is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomballow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint mran on her death bed that valentines wedding might not be deferred	36.2527
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes	80.9512
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the count of san felices flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning	82.3786
grandpapa says it is a panacea valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered	17.9892
every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy	82.6160
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her	21.6961
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all  god abandons him who abandons himself said milady	33.2651
you were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to fly	34.1908
albert and chteau renaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first	11.9462
then he thought he was going to die	22.6655
oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he iswhere we can find him	32.1534
the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it  and have you replied to everyone as you have to me  ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones  were you at the opera yesterday  no  he was there  ah indeed	92.5723
i tell you valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m noirtier	29.5526
but  propos resumed m de trville what has become of your three companions  i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them  none monsieur  well i left them on my roadporthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crvecur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining  see there now said m de trville and how the devil did you escape  by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry  there again	71.4740
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not  tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head	68.5847
come said he	14.8803
oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	17.9991
enough asked m de trville	10.3945
to join the army under the prince count  and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	32.3148
he is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	54.8351
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced	16.9356
ah	29.0941
0173m    will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell  let us visit them all said the inspector	38.7151
can he have and she stopped	114.7966
i examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was empty	40.6023
the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it	62.8914
athos smiled	60.3495
go to the devil	25.7238
what	73.5983
there is one comfort we are all in cash said dartagnan	21.2614
adieu  au revoir	6.8479
he will see us if we go out  then you must come up into my room  ah said mme	35.1990
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon	18.1301
now this was a sunday and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	30.4367
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said chteau renaud	11.6665
what	90.0879
and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related  because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness	104.9001
listen said the young man to the sentinel	12.3151
you know you may say anything to me	22.8279
jealousy fury offended pride all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love urged her to make a revelation but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that dartagnan would also be lost to her forever	363.5587
what do you propose  zounds	16.6249
help help murmured mme	14.1570
eugnie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo  the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly	29.3893
john felton i put faith in your loyalty  my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire  milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance	142.3802
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son	65.7173
unfortunately i didnt crush him flat	27.0727
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris i had need of distraction  well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said dartagnan	23.2976
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us drink  what asked the host quite cheerful again	42.7274
just so	22.4262
she goes into england said athos	53.8959
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor	53.1606
what is this name of monte cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title  i believe mother it is merely a title	22.4534
the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato	7.2247
he looked at alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it	18.9838
i sleep no longer monsieur	104.8475
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but  i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen	25.4490
it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape  i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures	19.5265
he is a man of from fifty to fifty two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache	19.9758
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty	23.4906
i own myself conquered	43.1506
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche	20.6452
listen	90.9841
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse and m danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million  and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole  yes they sent me the order of charles iii returned debray carelessly	35.5352
adieu and a prosperous voyage	37.9536
bonacieux	44.2994
i shall not go  why asked porthos	36.6653
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us 50000 francs for it	30.1514
there go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred  30147m      chapter 57 in the lucern patch  our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m de villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance	143.4964
there is myself replied milady	144.4009
you must do so  certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god  well then sire continued dartagnan listen to the noise of the people you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder  in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze then all at once it ceased	58.4593
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs	20.6183
explain it athos  groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself  dartagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	112.3641
remain parry	50.5540
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	13.5971
the baroness was astonished	116.4558
porthos	30.4855
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette  madeleine was the daughter of m davrigny and antoinette his niece	22.7409
the abb made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	17.6352
aramis started back and drew his	32.7371
i	49.2688
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity	29.1000
i think i have sprained my wrist said porthos	22.0240
what can i do for the son	16.2108
master broussel is being strangled  it was friquets voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	16.3656
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	49.1410
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others she must die therefore i warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everythingthis murder which has deprived me of my namethis murder which has impoverished methis murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacablei shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when i discover them  with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward de winter	98.5572
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them  not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesyour father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them	145.3486
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle	36.7984
well but we should be taken out of prison madame bonacieux was released	38.0245
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have	8.6248
she has near her a certain laporte  who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal	42.7496
pray relate it to me  caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time  well my good friend returned the abb in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	112.4386
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio	204.7874
you raised the whole district so they told me  very nearly replied planchet with a self satisfied air	49.1157
no said felton it is nothing  but what then is the noise  that of the patrol going their rounds  where is their road  just under us  they will discover us  no if it does not lighten  but they will run against the bottom of the ladder  fortunately it is too short by six feet  here they are	67.9316
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side	64.8487
patience	44.6800
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the diamond  the devil said dartagnan becoming angry again	50.9898
ah	43.9190
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces  and what will she do now asked the young man	57.3195
he was very taciturn this worthy signor	29.4822
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friends arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queens service  yes its true	38.6500
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment	18.6921
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness  youre a great moralist and thats the fact said porthos	25.6542
do you not know him  i have not that honor  you have never heard his name  never  well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children  now then albert cried franz here is a bandit for you at last  i forewarn you signor pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin	39.9413
come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape  that is forbidden me said grimaud until the last moment  who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch  i know nothing about it my lord  but at least if you dont want to see me turn crazy tell what that famous pate will contain  two poniards a knotted rope and a poire dangoisse    this poire dangoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust into the mouth by the aid of a spring dilated so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width	119.5137
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count	14.4902
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of	22.8535
does not his appearance speak for him	56.8592
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door  wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door	30.7037
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	16.0536
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen	44.0952
take pity on me then and go	40.2241
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days	99.8012
dartagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the door	41.8508
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile we leave paris tomorrow  have you nothing more to do there asked morrel	30.2154
and whatever might beconsidering the violent character of miladythe danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her	39.7092
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain	55.4797
do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud	11.4275
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos	38.2327
the trial	1407.8369
at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die  edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor	114.8422
1f3	94.0703
why  an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	15.5789
dartagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist	38.2001
it is not courage that is needed it is prudence  and yet cried porthos we will not leave  you will leave dartagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos	50.5689
why they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the queen  dartagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability	41.1377
the ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus ball	15.2231
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	27.5844
france will not perhaps be always ungrateful	71.2106

albert placed it in his button hole and the carriage went triumphantly on	12.8356
pass replied dartagnan	86.6479
what has the count done	68.2929
tell him also what you have just told methat mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity  which cannot last interrupted comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison here  but there are oubliettes replied athos smiling	41.8839
you told me that  what matters it to you kitty	37.8480
isnt this fox a genius athos asked the gascon	22.2389
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure	29.4468
dartagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing  he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	166.0107
are you on the ground asked dartagnan	19.3907
i say that he is ill informed	33.1676
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open dartagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid	34.5587
why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever  and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal	164.2774
as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor pastrini the proprietor of the htel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them	42.9810
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods	100.1382
the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious	64.2419
it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i cannot take off my doublet for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself  that is true monsieur replied dartagnan and whether drawn by myself or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman	63.6751
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived	29.5910
what do i know of the grecian affair	21.0245
at each shot morrel turned pale	143.3622
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux	32.7074
7 the others are on the mantle piece of your excellencys bedroom  good what oclock is it  four oclock  monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerfs and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way	91.8702
mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt  but athos exclaimed dartagnan	46.4576

as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day  dartagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails	70.1527
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things	14.7941
athos replied the musketeer	41.3128
at last they reached the tennis court	26.8709
is it to make me a captain	23.7323
m bonacieux who was ignorant that dartagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinals executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture	77.6095
you see said he calling dartagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my domains  all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied dartagnan	50.4888
when in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held secret	45.3191
you have sent for me sir said athos to m de trville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders	21.2899
come my dear bazin tell me where he is  didnt you hear me tell you monsieur dartagnan that i dont know where he is  yes certainly but to that i answer that it is impossible  it is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good god  dartagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided	60.3956
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	37.7597
i hope so  the friends embraced cordially dartagnan pressed raouls hand	28.6436
let us try him  my friend said he slowly i wish as the son of an ancient friendfor i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly truei wish i say in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you to discover to you the secrets of our policy	47.4151
mme	57.1220

these proceedings made dartagnan and porthos draw back	49.7911
daiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women	4.6029
i have always found them and morei repeat it with joy with triumphi have always found some proof of human perversity or error	30.0940
i dont like people to quiz me  sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please  dartagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	20.9536
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead  your son shall be happy mercds repeated the count	53.2867

you pretend to pardon me and you poison me  i cried dartagnan	31.8261
do you know her  milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid	23.3814
i will continue then resumed aramis	96.1571
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her	20.8552

i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to wait  let him be sent for instantly  your majestys orders shall be executed but  but what  but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey  my orders  yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king  well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself  your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture  yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that  whenever it shall please your majesty but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france  very well cardinal very well but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals	77.6794

the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemaryfor upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before	201.8540

yes and now i shall be more calm  you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling	24.7650
the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers	43.2583

he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	31.3431
how could this ring come into the hands of milady clarik	24.8935

the turnkey closed the door behind them	27.3147

at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to dartagnan that m dessessart made him a sign to approach	17.7178
i cannot see	32.0166
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself	83.7730

approach sir said the cardinal	12.3370
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him	22.1155
prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities  40276m    listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be	16.1961

two or three times a week	9.8265
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa	13.8875
i dare not say more in a letter	43.8352
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account  how was that  how	24.0674
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely	16.4459
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds  i think i have some clew  but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot  beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	72.9061
but the third time which is the present you may succumb	31.8801
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence  perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box  which box do you mean asked the countess	127.6917
it is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a master  come you are joking yourself now	22.9204
40152m    as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect	39.7782
my dear count cried morcerf you are at faultyou one of the most formidable logicians i knowand you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist	12.9109
one window was lighted	158.9510
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	9.9867
think for a moment	25.1884
who is this creature  grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time	39.0297
pierced hearts said athos	16.3149
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter	31.8491
this was alberts favorite lounging place	10.9209
but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation  noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation	19.5269
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board	55.0137
reverend sir  you lie	21.1255
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening	12.8100
great heavens suddenly exclaimed debray	90.6700
and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my name  and raoulwhat shall you do with him  i leave him with you my friend	26.7965
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another	32.4208
give me anything you like it is of little consequence  go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints	27.2481
first m and madame de saint mran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirthree drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretchhe therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest  why what nonsense are you telling us said chteau renaud	218.2229
where does he live  rue frou two steps from here  let us go  both resumed their way	36.9281
0323m    like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display	9.2014
another queen in want of help	36.7077
ho replied aramis	13.7591
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand	6.5402
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur  it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release broussel from prison and give him back to the people  oh cried anne to humble myself thus	55.4368
we have no time to lose i will question and do you answer me noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer	28.5577
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service dartagnan  i shall be grateful to you all my life  very well	39.8350
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known	17.8594
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork	9.4469
this is what i propose to do said athos	18.3245
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing  hush said athos we are overheard  in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	110.8668
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol	43.1937
she called the maid and questioned her	50.4389
alas	45.8798
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	14.0198
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk	74.5330
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii	19.7858
then you hope said davrigny with surprise	90.1629
what	98.1741
but never mind that will do capitally  dartagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs	27.6924
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person	24.9631
at length he interrogates me said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result	31.8130
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility	40.0090
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him	25.8088
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years  well in spite of that dartagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her  no indeed said dartagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance  you see then dartagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is  athos said dartagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven  so then said athos offering his hand to dartagnan	77.6804
of what country are you asked the prince	30.5162
his company was on guard at the louvre he was at the louvre with his company	20.9337
dartagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy	29.2597

laporte could not leave the louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide	27.4521
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been	33.2079
the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dants declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his beds head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself	501.4226
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission	32.9359
fie  pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher  higher	22.9187
no no my dear edmondmy boymy sonno but i did not expect you and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyah i feel as if i were going to die  come come cheer up my dear father	50.4745
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat	22.2058
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	40.0926
i know not where i have left my hat and in all probability i should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me  ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this  madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh  very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all i wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back  yes madame but i only came back on one conditionthat i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people  the will exclaimed the queen frowning	39.6516
sure enough said the general	18.6967
then the inconvenience became distress	23.9758
1c	94.1382
how badly	84.7841

to night we stop at derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it	35.2255
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted	18.8483

in which the plot thickens   his visit to m de trville being paid the pensive dartagnan took the longest way homeward	20.6994
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him  now then go said the marquis	21.6824
we must let monsieur de beaufort come  in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de cond had arrived	31.7698
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon perfected	45.3977
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe	47.9657
let the man go dartagnan let us save the woman  monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat	74.0354
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in two parties had set out for paris	36.8928
they stopped him at the door	21.5853

i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me	27.1758
monsieur dartagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity	48.4910

chapter lxiii	97.7828
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room  well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that	136.9449
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventy five pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the bargain	58.9668
you know it is you alone whom i love  how can i know that  by the scorn i will throw upon her  dartagnan took a pen and wrote  madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them	69.9801
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher	33.8028
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a housethe opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villeforts bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age	170.3950
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury	39.7500
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for	48.7337
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	40.1877
at least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six months before us  no madame said villefort instructions have been given	45.5996
the one i have hired for you  where will it take me  where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth  what are you going to do at portsmouth asked milady	73.9169
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct	14.1502
speak my friend i listen  there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear  oh yes yes exclaimed dants and i tell you that i will save you yet  well then try	79.9786

in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of st bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsla rochelle is impregnable except to famine	72.1422
he took his army to the priests where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornets who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal  dartagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companionsas the breakfast at the priests could only be counted as half a repastin return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him	172.2323
nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it  mercds said the old man	108.1120

30297m    at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercds one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	110.3286
several times even i felt a smile on my lips	32.0543
chapter xlii	76.8916

dartagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions	29.0909
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of svres	20.7073

dartagnan	15.5326

the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself	1380.3417

ah my yellow horse cried he	61.5884
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	34.4124

nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of men i admire greatly  still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person	458.6591

how has this terrible past been recalled cried villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame  alas said hermine doubtless it is chance  chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance  oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this	111.4877
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me i only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark	139.1692

in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate dartagnan  milady was livid	184.7058
the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans the tall young mademoiselle and the abb de la riviere and the third the duke de longueville and the prince de conti brother and brother in law of cond	99.6622
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words	62.2004
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough  in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong  as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france	107.8789
your name cried his eminence for the third time	26.2600
then give me that letter madame said the chancellor	47.1771

my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern	29.2129
as for me i shall be deceived all my life perhaps but i shall always have faith in a person whose countenance inspires me with sympathy  you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent  the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses  permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess	44.8909
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone	21.1883

he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said  i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing  i doubt it planchet replied dartagnan but what are you thinking of  i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested  always cautious planchet  tis instinct your honor  well what does your instinct tell you now  sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in  ah ah said dartagnan planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	286.2488
ah ah	23.7077

ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of dartagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends	41.4733
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris  how does that annoy you  it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose  so said andrea you are speculating upon me  what fine words he uses  i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken  well well dont be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous	103.5834

now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast	52.5476
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear	66.9085
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy	51.8310
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence  who are they replied the duke	109.3894
i own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep	33.4624
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends  there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis	70.8393
in this garden mercds had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years previously	96.7049

the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably	10.9883
finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid	36.3855
as mademoiselle de scudery remarks  scarron and raoul laughed	9.2800
whether noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him	12.9633
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur labb is repeating to me said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable  raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse	39.9898

ask him then for the written order	73.6796
frightful	23.2045
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward	20.0877
the poor girl under the caresses of dartagnan lifted her head	28.4358
the prince read as he hastened on	74.9432
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment  you are then a chemist  somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis  but for such a work you must have needed bookshad you any  i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know	602.9979
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned	26.4323
he took her to his chteau and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly  well asked dartagnan	75.2989

so you and the cardinal have been talking about me	48.1485
you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people  so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count  upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered but  but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs de montmorency and lafayette	196.3452
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me  and both with free use of the spur arrived at st omer without drawing bit	30.7924
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter	53.5411

at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat	12.6895
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself  then replied dartagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me and though hes but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me  the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes	66.9994
never exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never	39.0029
the counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man	27.7036
well here are 8000 francs on account  the majors eyes sparkled brilliantly	11.3559
wait said athos	17.9632
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	65.8103
the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings	15.0347
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you	128.1113
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i  albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut i will believe all you say so proceed  but if your excellency doubt my veracity  signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience	65.4479
save me	1.4061
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am	50.6136

have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers	30.5551
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	31.6669

this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation	50.4160
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint  a very simple one said valentine	23.1470
the position in which he had left him was critical	30.1211
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had done	41.4294
stop	38.7505
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo	17.5558
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	39.9535
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable	52.6793
thanks replied the jeweller	28.7036
he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away	27.4326

this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them  and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty  then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume	54.9672

now as a quarter past one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes mercds will have become madame dants  0069m    fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company	111.4336
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less	62.3549

yes it is i my unclei the son of miladyi the monki the secretary and friend of cromwelli know you now both you and your companions  in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins	422.2591

he caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud  of whom i bought her said monte cristo as i told you albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills  oh you are good you are great my lord said hayde kissing the counts hand and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master  albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard	225.6053
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals  what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me  all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor	67.9232
franz continued  it was as we said the fifth of february	31.5915
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter	138.6599
the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery	33.2888
selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered	27.9757
besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the htel of m de trville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance	53.7714
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited thats all	95.1088
but where is franz  in the first carriage with m de villefort who considers him already as one of the family  40024m    such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m davrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m de villefort	41.8698
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him	32.3097

for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases  madame said dartagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him  what	33.6427
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture	18.0457
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports	33.6545
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends	20.8516
now say if i conceal anything from you  no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich  yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune  is it possible  it is evident enough to me who am always at his house	92.8495

i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long night	35.8682
i have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh  so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it  hush said dartagnan the some one is coming  the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	31.4878
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps	30.8132
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	94.5407
yes that you sent me  we sent you wine  you know very wellthe wine from the hills of anjou  yes i know what brand you are talking about  the wine you prefer  well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that  and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou wine said porthos	160.5408
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the kings attorney  and this kings attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly	95.9868
oh it would be a sacrilege	27.9905
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house	23.5363
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	68.8431
the sign of the red dovecot   meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of r and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm	89.8617
determined to put the advice of m de trville in practice instantly dartagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise	18.4648
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the 8th of septemberthat is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my lifethe abb busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire	172.7375

it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us  30241m    lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room	138.9634
this was the departure of fernandof fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother	25.0398
silence said dartagnan pressing her hand more closely	15.9847
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	80.4757
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief	86.0106
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	38.1908

chapter lxxix	54.8934
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	58.9416
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	20.0932
he put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning	30.0517
the name is not unknown to me the marquis of saint mran and he appeared to meditate	25.9397
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson  french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends	19.0045
in case any evil should happen to me said bragelonne	46.9667
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise  and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us	32.9399
chapter xlviii	46.4610

the count of monte cristo is always an early riser and i can answer for his having been up these two hours  then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly  20155m    oh i am quite sure	31.4968
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give	39.1996
now is that all  i believe so  let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth dartagnan and athos to the bastille aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse porthos an ass madame bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion armentires on the banks of the lys	137.0119

he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide	54.0995
maximilian you are no ordinary man	61.6457
she closed the door after her took the duke by the hand and after a few experimental steps grasped a balustrade put her foot upon the bottom step and began to ascend the staircase	19.7489
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject	17.7101
ten days passed away thus	15.0222
this modern place of entertainment stood on the left hand side of the post road and backed upon the rhne	17.9752
do you know them fernand he said	21.4551
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him	26.5073
well where the devil are you going now cried athos	22.6207
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with chteau renaud and beauchamp	17.9389
they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and m de trvilles note in the other	23.1260
dartagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	29.6107

he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain	45.4685

you scoundrel cried dartagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword	29.2783
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale	26.2754
well be on our side now resumed aramis	47.9329
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces itno madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison  madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features	55.6912

i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday  oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivals attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernandhe was ghastly pale	86.7263
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination	50.7634

we have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners  there could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received dartagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwells health	90.1087
i think so indeed	29.2210
yes appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor	28.3307

no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence rene uttered a smothered exclamation	34.0201
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugnie to the opera	197.9513
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber	33.0520

then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress	59.2633
and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself  i should my dear dartagnan have been so but nature said no when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too	112.3058

indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration	52.3750
how	52.7066
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding  franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion	118.9489

but tell me what do you ask  nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something  the procurators wife hung upon the arm of porthos and in the violence of her grief she cried out monsieur porthos i am ignorant of all such matters	30.7045
listen for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream	62.9137
impossible impossible  but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receiptedthe splendid diamond	48.1589
what do you want monsieur demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to dartagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures	18.6182
and the steward followed the notary out of the room	25.0789
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts content	32.9118

but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody  so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate  but this is trampling on the weak sir  the weakness of a murderer  his dishonor reflects upon us  is not death in my house  oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you  be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture	172.5709

he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	26.0382
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted but as she was only a procurators wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you dont offer me any holy water  porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years	38.9374
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you  yes sir answered raoul	46.6763

when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson  french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300000 francs and have those 300000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again  unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision	164.5914

one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body	41.9399
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled  danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said  count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me  these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing  danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed	99.6132
oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people  just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	162.5850

ah my friend said the abb turning towards dants and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass  probably if ever i get out of prison  true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty  but wherefore are you here  because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811 because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my csar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me	114.5392

after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea	93.0144

porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	32.4778

laporte pointed to the child who was asleep	21.9627
come in here said davrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay	28.8479
amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos	30.2980
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	38.6434
ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded  oh things take their course without our assistance	19.6802
he had formed his resolution	31.1121
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly  you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal	123.6151
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh	58.2839

yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him  what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal	67.0298
it is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then i remember as we remember a dream	24.9352
but i as you see am nailed to my bedah	24.9474
it follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should  that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults  faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air	158.5701
40070m    from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going	40.5517

in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart  the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine oclock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it	31.6210
diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh	20.8602
he thought of his wife	21.7022
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well  this is a council of state dartagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis  at the saint gervais bastion said porthos	77.2509
nevertheless he pressed dartagnans hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered	34.3276
the lady with the red cushion produced a great effectfor she was very handsomeupon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon dartagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady	48.3483
m	17.6049
it was necessary to separate	18.0057
i took a wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers	27.9832
were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the bastion saint gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army  such feats sir are done onceand never repeated  however nowadays theres no need of so much heroism	46.1217
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last night  dartagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents  you saw your wi  hush interrupted athos	106.1364

he passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback	151.2109
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head	25.9459

oh this is too much cried milady	16.3262
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me	31.0396
without passports he murmured	20.3825
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	15.2643

let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said dartagnan for the count must be furious  comminges began to laugh	25.5204

some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more	7.9496

the guide carried away the torch	41.2067
dartagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake	14.3835
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand	147.9562

mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by dartagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villars cotterets	92.7894

it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression	14.4670
the article was not inserted by mei was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so  sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons  certainly my dear sir  and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet  no no i will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocationin my opinion the time ought not to be yet	91.1647
at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercds at the second he reminded her that he loved her	75.4114
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this	35.7873
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted	17.3689
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man	146.3448
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in paris but in venice	39.0014
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	13.1458
then adieu valentine  valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them	37.2188
of this treaty at least i have been warned	17.4422
what orders asked milady	272.7389
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries	23.1616
interested man cried she smiling	33.6991
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	40.7121
look at me well in your turn	20.0613
he lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to heaven and recognized friquet	59.6715
0295m    it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	35.3510
his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken man	14.6111
here said she you see i have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold  but you  oh i am never cold you know	27.6544
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing	101.8333
planchet dartagnans valet supported his good fortune nobly	16.1860
planchetart thou there cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears	25.6764
there is the subject simplified	12.6912
do think of it giulio	43.3702
about eleven oclock in the morning they perceived amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn	9.7662
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof	32.7776
you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that	14.8300
the cardinal writes better than i thought	28.0904
while he was endeavoring to calm his fearsand instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long sleptthe noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masters grief	106.0513
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend  40178m    i am broken hearted said albert	12.3665
thats where we are	45.4680
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	12.8752
it was completely deserted	22.0278
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny	26.3531
i have at length then intelligence of you	69.5018
there remained in the bankers house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eugnie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise darmilly	138.5072
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon for if hes a coward he will disgrace thee some day  monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammonts regiment and i refused to accompany him  monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said dartagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong heres a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him i will cut out thy tongue	395.1714
i have promised to escort to the acadmie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither  adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription  ah in truth madame to do that i must forget the hours conversation i have had with you which is indeed impossible  monte cristo bowed and left the house	99.1451
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men	50.5465
nothing is impossible  on paper  in execution	174.3769
now the portmanteaulet us make hastethe portmanteau  stop said louise going to listen at madame danglars door	28.6870
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	80.9893
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	51.7178
come with me then	23.8612
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors the former life of the prisoner his transformation a review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur	115.0302
who could these men be	79.5682
then i shall also remain then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans head he slowly added by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live  faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose	66.6646
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed	20.1133
oh yes especially beautiful	124.8273
they separated and dartagnan rushed between them like a dart	40.4692
the palace of the louvre contains two thingsthe king who must die and royalty which never dies	31.1631
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king	32.5133
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone  athos smiled	30.1840
the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness	38.3997
although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty	12.2483
0185m    nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time	20.7407
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger	28.9642
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean  he went to find aramis	53.2122
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed	69.0053
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed  julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived  the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	91.7752
that man is cromwell said he	65.7241
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go	26.2166
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy	53.8680
and the other  which  the short one  oh he was not a gentleman ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration  some lackey murmured dartagnan	84.7238
i am fifteen years younger than he is	16.1828
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction	22.7577
have you really met with some great misfortune  oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustainednothing worth mentioning i assure you  true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit  it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900000 francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood  30183m    what do you say said the count 900000 francs	35.9033
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which dartagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	42.0985
oh mon dieu	7.4228
but you sent for me my dear child	23.8781
go on who were those men  one of them was a foreigner english i think	50.6599
every one arose	49.0980
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	124.1137
lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her	17.8709
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied	29.8329
i was sure of itthe cursed letter  dont be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure  ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps  well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed dartagnan i will go without you	175.4826
the monk	353.6852
what time do you breakfast albert  at half past ten  precisely asked debray taking out his watch	28.9107
how dartagnan and porthos earned by selling straw	25.2296
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood	20.3897
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me  oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad  i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me	61.1879
emmanuel accompanied me father	67.9319
gracious me said porthos theres phoebus ruined  the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles  im above that  let us set out again at full gallop  yes if we can  but at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall	395.0685
the very madness of the abb faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity	23.1671
they had understood each other without speaking	56.8928
they are yours take them  mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at dartagnan with open mouthed astonishment	40.2300
good morning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian  did you doubt it said the young captain	29.9068
then you know what i have suffered said mme	23.7232
from madame de montbazon he cried	14.7320
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led dartagnan into it	22.0694
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul	18.6274
today i am at your service replied the count	13.9350
shall you keep it or send it back  i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it	64.5585
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible	33.7639
as to felton he hesitates	82.3006
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow	43.7379
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with  there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	64.5928
fernand would have been court martialed if napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the bourbons	19.2545
if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand  20211m    well said the count turning towards franz i told you there was some mistake in this  are you not alone asked vampa with uneasiness	46.9412
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely	10.2483
on her side but as softly as possible kitty turned the key of the lock and then dartagnan opened the closet door	27.3522
come in gentlemen come in called dartagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal  then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party	48.1330
the two friends turned down the first street they came to	22.8286
noirtier made a sign that it did	12.3096
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you  i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo	42.4233
if i have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity me  but your mother asked the president	40.8850
he denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well  never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it	84.2137
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition	14.7484
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going	17.0738
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne	27.0978
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest	52.1609
well he said to the lieutenant	22.1155
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	14.8523
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	33.2264
grimaud obeyed	57.5588
come down  athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy	65.9176
the ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	14.2335
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent	44.8335
once upon a time well go on  signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them	77.2259
my hand said she	48.6686
the queen was ignorant where the mercers young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure dartagnan	103.8876
but hark hark	34.6754
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	26.7227
this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat	21.8013
upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog	37.9396
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eelsall light wholesome food suitable for the sick  but the wine said dartagnan who furnishes the wine	38.4998
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed	14.5792
dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	41.0750
that falls out oddly	17.3455
grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road	20.9262
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned dartagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	52.5183
what shall we do  what are we going to do ifaith	16.7375
edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing room my dear i wish to speak to your mamma  madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries	41.7032
i must find them within three days  three days are a short time and france is large  no matter you know the word must with that word great things are done  and when do you set out  i am now on my road  good luck to you  and to youa good journey  perhaps we shall meet on our road  that is not probable  who knows	96.5620
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy chair	17.3461
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercds in the world and he might yet be happy	21.0692
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away  that was true  ah	78.2350
i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire  yes said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him i think he was your colleague  precisely answered bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another	83.9360
we have fallen in with a party of spaniards	46.8660
oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prisonseventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambitionto a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instantwho sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living	115.6847
mistrust yourself john said he	3.5168
at last davrigny slowly uttered these words she is still alive  still cried villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is that  yes said the physician i repeat it she is still alive and i am astonished at it  but is she safe asked the father	173.2858
40221m    chteau renaud was at his post apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert	28.2042
we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people	6.9159
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	20.8177
at half past six the duke arose and said very gravely  certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times  you think so my lord answered la ramee	31.4883
the thing is simple enough	60.3943
nothing replied grimaud	41.3578
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered to morrow we shall know if you are good in action  and i said the marshal what am i to do  wait here to receive the troops	52.7123
on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides  yes added athos i now ask you dartagnan what side you are on	37.9600
the baron came forward	40.9447
she has experienced much anxiety but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly	61.2771
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly	13.8408
the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of dartagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that mme	47.5642
yes dead alas	834.6230
the duchess is at tours and the duke at boulogne	62.5041
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayvalentine has been assassinated  villefort hung his head davrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes	63.9335
and who has seen this fleur de lis inquired aramis	15.0846
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there	76.1699
in the first horseman she recognized dartagnan	38.3919
tis indeed they said she	79.4206
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point  if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title	72.2395
what the devil continued the king	18.7765
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	4.2460
all gazed at him searchingly	45.5710
dear dartagnan	12.6719
to speak to you about me  of what else do you imagine he would speak to me	25.4292
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of dartagnan	21.5242
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will  turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him  never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart  do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said dartagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon  the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle	123.0959
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them	22.0991
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them	27.4233
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago	24.5814
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room	25.9016
who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power	25.0810
do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall	26.8662
i read it a little while since	119.7118
do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand	29.9800
a gascon a match for cupid  chapter xxxvi	14.7050
order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters	44.1476
what the devil makes him glower thus behind him  when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity	22.7442
never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper i will compromise myself  well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy	53.0236
whither art thou going grimaud  to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor  they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention	35.8155
i thought you might want it to show the abb busoni  well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in full	44.2642
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together	26.3270
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m de trvilles htel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship havent i     chapter vi	22.8828
you are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you	73.4427
pray tell me how  i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilhere is my lamp so saying the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations	120.5685
since when i wonder in the musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it  since said dartagnan they have friends who ask it for them  ah ah said porthos it appears theres something fresh here  yes we are going said aramis	180.4521
50117m    these last consisted of all the young people whom valentines death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth	184.8839
do you know about that institution  i have heard of it  it is a magnificent charity having said this the abb bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies	20.9816
tell mewhere  there	36.4075
then i confess to you that i have eaten nothing since ten oclock this morning and i am devilish hungry  we will dine directly my friend only you must please to remember that this is friday	29.5351
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it	35.5716
so you like it you rogue  so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living  do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought  what is that  that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly  do not let that disturb you i have enough for two  no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse  good caderousse  so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs  yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me  true remorse and besides an idea had struck me  andrea shuddered he always did so at caderousses ideas	336.2134

as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone	20.8436
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed	28.1153
embrace also our good and brave porthos	61.6532
who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons	21.8579
providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner	39.5381
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well	22.2556
i tell you the queen does not love me i tell you she loves another i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham	29.5245
miladys son replied athos	16.6258
a horse for planchet thats all	103.4453
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you  why that question my dear host asked dartagnan	36.1840
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary  it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding	50.2339
yes yes i replied he	55.3851
see him and hear what he says  m	39.7410
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune	82.5362
have we overtaken them  good	30.0994
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes	28.0120
he called it using his advantages	96.8563
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it  the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	21.8362
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised	29.8377
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here  indeed said dartagnan i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals  and i alsoi was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar self complacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke i should have got a lodging elsewhere  the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthoss words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated	160.8615
on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly	68.8680
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms	16.9484
in order to make ones way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman	19.9033
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality  enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post  the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking	98.1030
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said groslow	37.4991
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame  yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father  and he rushed out of the study	62.5838
the groom cried aloud for help	154.5553
good journey to him  with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	36.9658
did you not observe his despair on the journey	29.7802
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you  then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter	41.2620
answer continued milady	40.6816
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises  a peculiar smile passed over dants lips he squeezed jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain alone	119.1214
suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat	57.4560
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves	129.4860
escape  chapter lix	10.4432
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name  yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince	56.2533
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy	21.2376
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother	18.1071
the breakfast hour arrived but m de villefort was not at table	43.6522
free	49.5019
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine	66.8538
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy approaching	11.4770
i guessed all i followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all  if you have seen all madame you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me said monte cristo with awful calmness	76.6198
you will say that i keep it  i will perform your commission word for word my lord  and now resumed buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall i ever acquit myself of the debt i owe you  dartagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes	95.3251
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	25.4273
but i cannot said she i am not strong enough do you shut it  ah you do well to ask said eugnie laughing i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale  and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle darmilly passed the bolt of the padlock through	56.4245
and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him	27.0894
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome	25.8471
the note is changed	388.9731
so you have seen the arm that was all	51.7485
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier	61.7308
it was thus with milady	79.4335
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it	43.3874
besides which in a short time resumed dartagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety  well then i decide  i have your word then  yes tis given	23.2129
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours	19.6380
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community	12.1534
that was the question	39.3711
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs	97.5663
come come with me gentlemen exclaimed mazarin	40.4902
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme	38.8444
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dants and so lay bare the motives of villeforts plot	19.2579
an adventure on the high road	25.8156
in fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of february	18.5142
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france  ah that is different the house you purchase is at auteuil  at these words bertuccio turned pale	45.1661
soonstrange factaramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely	13.2756
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady	6.4812
at seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled	17.6561
impossible cried milady	31.6180
yes i wish to speak to him  valentine durst not oppose her grandmothers wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards villefort entered	15.3439
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	15.9704
in what can i have offended heri who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave	36.5434
ah there he is calling me now	57.5440
i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	37.2526
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat	44.2797
most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg	4.6416
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours  yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person it is  my lord i have not named her interrupted the young man warmly	32.7700
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle  bravo cried porthos	64.1461
do you not know the race said he	19.8474
alas i have them no longer  how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity  it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son  well let us see said mazarin isnt there still time to repair the evil	30.6633
the surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted	23.1620
is it as hopeless as he thinks  alas	20.8889
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him  mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to dartagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said  sir	147.5735
which means that i have just been dupedsixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour  dartagnan and athos laughed aloud	28.7792
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what	53.5914
noble and unhappy king  are you wounded cried aramis	52.9325
toward midday lord de winter entered	6.3660
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged  de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head	17.8899
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck	31.7807
to the boat  but porthos i do not see him  porthos is cominghe swims like leviathan  in fact porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward	66.2465
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else  the devil	28.0777
certainly	93.1225
let me die that is all	20.3407
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as dartagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him	33.1306
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	13.8866
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees	21.0163
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced	32.7221
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck	82.7290
you sent me a strange madman this morning	25.3292
yes my lord  and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society  certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal  and we start in his carriage then  yes my lord  and with us no other escort but you two  is it not enough	57.6960
well my faith	43.3241
she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof	16.1904
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse  the three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	41.3168
and gabrielle destreesas good natured as brave as proud and above all as gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated	16.3085
the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal	21.9781
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abb de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god  madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall	160.7981
oh dont let that disturb you cried mme	44.5344
we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor	80.3969
but what i know is that i promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going  and you will leave me then  yes  without waiting for my coming out again  yes  word of honor  by the faith of a gentleman	37.2069
1f1	98.6936
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days	23.7665
on saturday at six oclock	30.0830
to the palais royal he called out	13.9093
then why did you smile  why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine  do you want me to go away  ah no no	32.0952
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea  a pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercds herself	152.0689
but sit down said monte cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking ofi have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour  dont mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself	25.4254
we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours  hem muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering	12.9927
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles	28.8584
20131m      chapter 34 the colosseum  franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	172.9281
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury	53.8764
heigh sir said dartagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women	19.1954
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house  then you abandon me doctor  yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold	150.2883
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow	31.5655
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athoss lodging and there finish their plans	34.6276
alas returned villefort i must  where then are you going asked the marquise	45.6073
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door	23.3587
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed  oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune	46.2602
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athoss closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords	23.1204
oh my god said mme	10.1610
stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for me  having thus spoken dartagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	94.9268
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle	19.4606
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g  and who is the countess g inquired chteau renaud	31.4470
at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse	30.7924
diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration i should have cried i should  at this moment the tumult was heard nearer	25.4842
bonacieux dead and to dartagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life	37.9701
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass	15.5237
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved  and if you wished to die you would choose this death count  yes  morrel extended his hand	62.5071
he again ran back to the chteau	41.7203
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows	55.2487
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared	41.7344
now then all is agreed let us go down  you are going into the garden  yes  go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it  excellent thank you  and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	78.1940
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter  madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	37.2300
1e3	49.0211
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of the servants  yes replied noirtier	50.6919
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face	33.1600
and i who have sworn to take him dead or alive i am dishonoredand by you  kill me replied athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death  oh	29.4454
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince  but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal  oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	35.4553
and lord de winterdo you know anything about him  i know that he is in high favor with charles i  the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water	37.0177
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine	28.7408
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	74.8483
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him	55.8714
i was promised he should die with me	65.1414
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar	9.6477
50191m    the carriage stopped at the door of the house	3.8393
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance	20.0545
was there not some snare laid for her	44.0794
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and fainted	36.7143
do you keep a journal  no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself  do you talk in your sleep  30275m    i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember  the color mounted to the baronesss face and villefort turned awfully pale	71.7715
gad	59.6258
good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground  next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	25.8199
go to	5.0731
dartagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished	23.3155
then said albert you became the property of this man  40080m    no replied hayde he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople	30.1932
yes yes i see	23.8911
now said athos that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings entrance  they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings arrival	79.1562
i will warn them  what the devil are you going to do cried dartagnan you will be shot  but athos heeded not his advice	24.4617
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	40.8585
as to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut	66.1070
yes if my friends agree  but if they refuse can i count on you  i have never accomplished anything alone said dartagnan shaking his head	72.4744
there is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the old  therefore my dear mr oreilly you are my prisoner	86.6955
leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	18.7179
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappearthat i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection	54.6112
besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal	15.9627
not if it were my own brother cried dartagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm	41.9517
do you see that said the king	10.6571
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him	26.3450
it seems like a woman	41.5357
chapter li	59.0645
in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count  you have doubtless heard the adventures of m zaccones youth  the fathers  no the sons  i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade  was he in the wars  i think he entered the service  in what branch  in the navy  are you not his confessor  no sir i believe he is a lutheran  a lutheran  i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france  doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him	418.4609
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled	20.3152
on the staircase he met signor pastrini	16.5962
i will efface that blot on my fathers character	8.0715
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course	48.2361
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed	63.8423
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest	17.8249
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil  27 rue du helder on the 21st may half past ten am     chapter 39 the guests  in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion	365.8951
ah monsieur cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble	31.0396
bonacieux	44.6092
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come  nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you	246.1082
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme	34.0665
and to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way	103.1283
now will you make me a report of all that has happened  why i have related the events to you	26.0174
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately	259.8159
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts	25.6936
my friend said aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity	23.9609
you shall die  and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon dartagnan	119.7892
well well said monte cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind	23.1804
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	20.0538
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairoh who will deliver me from this man	10.9444
woe to them if it be so  and he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the seine	54.9531
be philosophers as i am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us drink	18.5850
hasty actions are generally bad ones	8.6267
here is what i am looking for thought dartagnan but alas	32.6788
she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham	32.3387
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	38.8969
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dants as if struck on his heart	19.5047
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement	50.4843
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	25.8534
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	15.4999
sign my lord and he gave him a pen	20.7460
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlightens	17.8833
what am i to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant	30.9698
onward cried the gascon	5.7484
oh	27.9558
you were deceived sir i was not praying  do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	81.8389
a new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead	31.6581
as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon	44.5130
you know how little i require said the old man	23.9041
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in dartagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected	73.6841
for the story	49.0994
the air i breathe is the air of liberty	104.6582
let us see said dartagnan	6.1976

we will escape and if we cannot escape we will talk you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love	55.2602
albert extended his hand	6.0657
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting	25.8708
m morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted	18.3892
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto  thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply  what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed  a womans letter monseigneur  ah yes i see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders  monseigneur said athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed marion de lorme nor madame daiguillon  the cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes	265.3788
a letter from charles the first	40.1545
felton my brother my friend i conjure you  no cried felton no you shall live and you shall be avenged  felton i bring misfortune to all who surround me	42.1576

i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle  oh heavens cried athos	13.9193
dartagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood	50.5874

franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction	20.4606

my poor eugnie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts  i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady	30.5563
monsieur is i am sure an honest man  take away that fool said the cardinal	35.7826
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony	46.4367
some of the men moved toward them	44.5738
alas	74.0483
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world  without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day  all day  yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box  you know him then  yes and no  how so  it is a long story  tell it to me  it would frighten you too much  so much the more reason  at least wait until the story has a conclusion  very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance	127.1353
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires  to this athos replied quietly we also have money leftfor i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs	157.6421
come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen	33.2378
i have returned guitant	104.6271
as the counts title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said  gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is thisthomson  french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me	146.6986
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore	27.0088
this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit  did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked beauchamp	120.5844
do you wish to see her noirtier again made an affirmative sign	13.4214
paris is not paved with cambric  monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said dartagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions	50.5486
thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my son  20115m    carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss father	16.3865

milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go  oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right	89.9278
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	218.8038
i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much	53.1402
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know it  how do i know it said dartagnan	25.4885

at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room	26.0339
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling	25.4615
this fortress was his post as kings attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition	68.7111

dartagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as dartagnan	66.3522
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps	47.5242
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion	40.2458
he wished to see everything	22.7125
really count if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you	28.4318
dartagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit	138.3080

dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	26.9647
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandits dinner through the crevices of the doormay i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy	56.7747
i say that he has hastily accused your majestys musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources  the accusation comes from monsieur de la trmouille from the duke himself	44.3743
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned  yes  do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him  no  do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine  yes  then will she die too asked davrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier	148.6274
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators  madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account  nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris	576.0369
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal	56.3994
here you are home again raoul said the comte	49.6016
yes said aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself  be satisfied replied dartagnan the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell  he then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller	127.2931
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us  it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore  where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council  yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis  a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it  there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	40.5732
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs	161.6616
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands	4.9572
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest	82.2516
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles	10.7632
at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal	30.2786

the devil thought dartagnan	73.6129
we have something very important to say to him  i understand said athos but why not porthos	27.8104
oh oh replied dartagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution  we must fly said the queen	27.3388
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	660.9871

the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation	175.7374
everything was in orderlaces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys	17.6702

no more edicts no more of the cardinals guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds	15.4474

why the man must owe me a fearful grudge  does his action appear like that of an enemy  no certainly not  well then  and so he is in paris  yes  and what effect does he produce  why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle marss diamonds and so people talked of something else  my good fellow said chteau renaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	186.0035
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of  that is true said porthos echoing dartagnans sigh	149.0261
dartagnan related his story simply with the omission of names	24.7152
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	126.5742
it was only to fight as an amateur	29.3965

i would lay a wager he has stolen it  do you think so answered dartagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity	83.8765
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel  sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse  morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	120.3422

i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine	30.0674
come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow morning  vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage	23.9024
dartagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself	13.0556
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked	32.0133
signed el kobbir  that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it  near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor	637.6195
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to dartagnans deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville	40.7083
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose  whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances dartagnan was the only man who could relieve the queens uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur dartagnan at once	109.0636
dartagnan saw that the moment was come	36.4662
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saint mran coffins	37.0507
one said the grave diggers two	35.8821
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy  yes replied aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess	42.8319
but his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it  so much the better said athos	41.5611
m noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerm	13.2077
that puts a different face on the matter	64.0388
no no i go i depart	74.8544
here is what the letter contained  milady be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be present	29.9224
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover	11.8914
lead two sheep to the butchers two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy	52.5394
valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven	20.1713
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display  the remembrance of milady recurred to dartagnan	42.8807
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortunebrilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any	77.1783
i have replied dartagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table	15.3219
and it will be even a disadvantage to you a left handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it	32.6327
go but to portsmouth or southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement	20.8359
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowling piece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree	204.6879
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather  no no no replied the eye of the paralytic	94.8988
patrick cried the duke opening the door of the chapel patrick his confidential valet appeared	16.5079
dartagnans eyes sparkled with joy	6.5976
oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade	22.2395
what i do care for now is to make my way into the jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their door	78.9728
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	22.9146
now then to breakfast said beauchamp for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert  morrel muttered albertmorrelwho is he  but before he had finished m de chteau renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all overthat is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemarttook alberts hand	147.3921
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lords passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personages past life	763.4939
well what have you to say	14.1354
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	199.3646
whats the matter asked aramis	7.5516
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants	30.9663
he found athos and aramis philosophizing	17.2979
but said franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was  20099m    ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely  i have  you intend visiting il colosseo  you mean the colosseum  it is the same thing	76.2220
go on my child said the count in the romaic language	9.9301
man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours	22.8037
you excel us all  athos smiled with ineffable pleasure	22.1659
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan	34.6597
well said franz anything newdo they refuse  on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him  well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objectionthe more so as i bring my share of the supper  oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house  his house	133.5446
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs	7.8018
give me therefore one more day before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality  if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate it will not be a house i shall see but a palace	74.6085

do i regret life	285.3008
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours  monte cristo shrugged his shoulders	47.7785
ah that would indeed be infamous  how did danglars usually write  in a handsome running hand  and how was the anonymous letter written  backhanded  again the abb smiled	96.7044
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations  certainly and that is why m and madame de saint mran have died that is why m noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to dieit is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his  edward	214.1070
no replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori	23.5091
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz dpinay  villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered	80.0155
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	16.7911
the steward entered	104.6865
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends  aramis shook his head	82.9940
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned	44.1716
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her	34.0390
dartagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuarts prison	29.7369
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa	22.7816
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him  albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked	126.0501
lend me your backbut dont let the cardinal go  porthos lent him his back and dartagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself	33.4242
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket	19.5354
but i doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the holy sepulchre  you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	26.4054
30087m    so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me  be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this	114.3846
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened	14.8074
nevertheless dartagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage	23.8219
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak  what became of you  as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me in instructed me in the calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family  and these researches  were fruitless chance did everything  you discovered what had become of your mother  i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i  oh	158.9286
thence introduced into a half subterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment	29.9075
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open arms	16.2369
have they not obeyed me  it is done as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure  that is well do as i have directed you then  what the devil said the host to himself	73.7790
a slight oscillation showed dants that all went well	40.8293
my adored valentine words cannot express one half of my satisfaction  valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier	623.3156
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress	48.1510
then he paused	25.2457
he awoke	1421.0217
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages	2.9913
he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear	27.8251
it is not natural for letters to enter peoples houses in this manner	20.9336
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m morrel left on old dants chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands  caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abb a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt	95.5568
six days	7.3445
oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist	18.8595
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	25.2791
when the two musketeers had entered when the door was closed behind them when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced when m de trville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on paradehe stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday eveningdo you know gentlemen  no replied the two musketeers after a moments silence no sir we do not  but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow	57.6965
sir	19.6363
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fathers love	41.9343
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number one	52.9234
i should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice	34.6590
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de chteau renaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride	112.4030
this letter was from my brother	37.5482
well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him	16.2507
it will be a splendid session     chapter 100 the apparition  as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered	20.6409
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m davrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime	69.1458
go in whatever guise you choose for my part i shall go unarmed  no for i will not allow you to do so	22.7754
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away	50.4807
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him	12.3715
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed here  he then closed the door of the landing	34.7972
she passed the night thus	57.6507
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together  indeed replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed  eh	41.8874
there is a carriage coming said chteau renaud	15.7447
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos	30.2694
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abb fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	19.2731
he is going to fall cried morrel	50.7929
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	93.1701
the carnival was over	75.0613
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency  charles shook his head	15.3279
i have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses	30.8327
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight  what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	309.1559
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson  french of rome with whom your father does business  the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase	48.3857
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it  nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces  no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it byi saw it lying in a corner  hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk  where is fernand inquired caderousse	176.9011
he is my demon apparently	39.4631
dartagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times	95.6373
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner	39.1866
let us save ourselves  at these words she passed her arm under that of dartagnan and urged him forward eagerly	33.8632
whom does this belong to he inquired	47.2701
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know  i fight in the cause of honor  ah that is something serious  so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service  what is it  to be my second  that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home	97.3945
the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help	71.7184

and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them  cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men	100.1678
yes	68.5113

the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened	127.1679

still five days before us	43.6479
be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk  as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion	85.5415
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the cur for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained  it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo	19.6615
order whatever you like for supperthe only thing i specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that i will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his piesnot only now but when i leave my prison  then you think you will some day leave it said la ramee	168.8682

the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	21.6569
oh no exclaimed edmond that will not be	26.5569

speak  he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guardsan appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers  tis the appointment monsieur de trville held you ask of me  the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de trville has left it it has not been filled  but it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household  monsieur de trville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years  you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed	157.6749

during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted	122.8979
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinire his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on	47.8465

athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers	55.7416
very well come this way  dartagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	37.0559
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	94.7038

but how is it that madame de villefort is not here  poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends	31.8914
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris  eugnie covered her face with her hands	43.4182

the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there	27.4420
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim	9.8698
let us rather kill them	50.1407
dartagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god	133.5378

and you  i shared the same fate at aquapendente  do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own  doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention	68.5395
i will ask the cardinal  it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fte  yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that  it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs  that is to say madame  it was he sire it was he  well and what does it signify whether it was he or i	66.0159

all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	38.6720

but dartagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts	57.0622
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	38.3805

well said porthos to aramis we must do something  monsieur is full of generosity said athos	45.8726
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke dangouleme were called the petits maitres	20.5235

what did you say sir asked the man	14.1193
here is monsieur comminges said dartagnan returning to the cardinal	22.6256
but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of dartagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer	87.3832
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of dartagnan	17.6536

totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass	207.5240
mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris	16.7989

then all is agreed said she	59.6759
but dants was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	33.0247

to the smaller  i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen  well what has happened to them  they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate  eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and dartagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men  the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers  arrested were they inquired athos is it known why  no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones  tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis	44.7594

but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise darmilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company	411.3379

there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco knownfrom the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakiawas exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers	554.3056
he reached it before the carriage arrived	71.1177
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening	23.1186
a mattress was laid upon the deck for him	21.2467
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters	135.9424
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy  faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus	40.9054
my arm and my life belong to you like my love  then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving  she stopped	46.2638
when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings	33.7043
she took the risk upon herself	141.2467
the door is opened to all who knock	59.1902
the city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutineers	24.3344
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	49.6686
whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantsinstructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty	24.7948
i will give them	24.3074
hallo fernand	2.4654
it was worn by my father a loyal gentleman	41.8276
the old mans declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said  then doubtless dear m noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort  the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred	94.3409
your friends soul must stick tight to his body  were you there then  monsieur i followed them from curiosity so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing me  and what took place  oh	73.7204
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable	26.4301
danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl	17.1209
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive  but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded	98.2328
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh	29.0334
but we have not done with the thing yet  0087m    do you indeed think so inquired the marquise	29.8536
they must disappear broken scattered annihilated	17.2541
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	184.4510
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on	27.1401
set out for naples the hague or st petersburgcalm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot headed parisians	24.6664
this personage was m bonacieux the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and chivalric period	12.7239
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	24.1041
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	115.4408
i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them	80.5089
that is not an answer replied athos	22.6868
but are you seriously wounded	83.3393
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	34.4414
while monsieur darminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry	37.4733
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved	7.7507
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him	30.2661
suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture	14.1751
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer  perhaps you like repose she said	29.3688
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crsus	53.8991
all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance	83.7384
he was in a most elegant hunting costume and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him	22.4437
the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation	12.1057
he immediately fell backward	71.7750
me said nanette	639.7648
he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks	26.2335
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	157.9888
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable	35.4617
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone	26.3104
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men	26.9571
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached	27.0028
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel	45.0746
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but noall was hermetically sealed	21.9031
thanks to what aramis had told him dartagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon	77.9092
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta	68.4265
yes madame replied the coadjutor i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom  the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced	24.1884
come comegive it to me	7.2626
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me  then today madame  oh today i am no further than gratitude  ah	52.3046
a carriage was in waiting	51.4256
grimaud followed athos	178.3033
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you  you have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old man	39.7480
chapter xxxii	55.7412
morrel called her and she ran to the gate	19.8287
you tell me of m franz dpinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart	25.3227
capricious and unfaithful the king wished to be called louis the just and louis the chaste	26.6540
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital  yes monseigneur  you came through meung where something befell you	40.0711
look at me madameat me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly	22.5411
you are righthe is worth us all and we avow it to you  aramis said athos are you jesting  no no dear friend i state only what we all know	54.2571
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others	17.5530
chapter lxxxviii	177.4798
are you also in accord with spain and england with madame de chevreuse and the queen  sire replied the cardinal sighing i believed myself secure from such a suspicion  monsieur cardinal you have heard me i will have those letters  there is but one way  what is that  that would be to charge monsieur de sguier the keeper of the seals with this mission	54.9103
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin  thats all very well replied dartagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady  you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman  a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh	209.4897
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m de trvilles surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground	36.9522
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step	431.1807
come sit down and tell us all about this signor vampa  i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla  well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni  20101m    this replied signor pastrini that you will go out by one but i very much doubt your returning by the other  why asked franz	57.5461
porthos uttered a deep groan	16.8227
you have the window that is sufficient	71.5691
how so returned the count with surprise	49.1964
i wont have dants killedi wont  and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied danglars	17.1966
they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him  when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person  yes  have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune  yes  i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions  yes  there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation	133.5551
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin	40.3642
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	37.2866
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched miladys forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul i will blow your brains out  with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos	162.2860
mazarin took the letter and read it thus  mr	24.3428
psaccording to the desire of your eminence i report to the convent of the carmelites at bthune where i will await your orders   accordingly that same evening milady commenced her journey	23.4109
i will make you all captains with good pensions	18.4689
the striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows	211.7918
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language	31.4277
now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself  ah	11.0258
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover	12.6437
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maid servant	42.2668
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds	22.4993
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and chteau renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back	63.8720
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded  mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under arms	18.7048
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto dartagnans	60.7989
peste returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me 3000 francs  let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself	35.3846
bonacieux re entered	17.5843
is there any crime in this request  no sire  then you will appear  yes sire  that is well said the king retiring that is well i count upon it  the queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her	89.0697
all i have is at his service  the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse  yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service  gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest	107.8111
the king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh  athos did not reply he reflected	35.8917
by the governors orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath  to the dungeon then said the corporal	27.6432
my prisoner he cried	100.7415
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis	17.9998
athos cried the two musketeers	31.6821
0127m    meanwhile what of mercds	68.0591
i	50.2011
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire	79.4508
you have an order signed by the cardinal said the governor	21.0968
yes  these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation	22.1679
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican bandits  and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers  alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another	67.9039
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage	24.5340
my profession condemns me to celibacy	12.5504
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	18.1729
so much the worse and so much the better  it need not be said that dartagnan was still thinking of the husband	16.2784
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps	31.4681
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand	27.9229
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron	16.9076
he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged	24.8945
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband  julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster	47.2951
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that dartagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not dartagnan	62.1825
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms	15.3976
he turned up a king	103.2149
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally  i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve  you serve the cardinal  yes madame and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart	150.3364
what can you expect athos	35.2946
his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself	63.8332
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles	15.6815
40306m     volume five  50009m    50011m    50019m      chapter 96 the contract  three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five oclock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle eugnie danglars and andrea cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristos house and the count was preparing to go out	477.6905
and where will your worship drink  there answered the traveler pointing to the table	21.4563
under the other cardinal continued dartagnan we didnt know enough to make our profits this however doesnt concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me  porthos sighed	39.5970
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice  work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind  yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cli comederunt illam  plague stifle you and your latin said dartagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted	56.1554
who are you said the pilot in bad french	28.3126
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon  capitalnothing replied mercds with a mournful smile	65.8977
no it has been stolen from you  stolen	48.6837
the two friends repaired to athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them	52.5084
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world	30.7884
the king pointed this out	107.8764
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect	21.9629
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow	23.7312
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster	15.3844
marie michon continued athos	6.4964
i depend upon you to escort me home	44.0400
kittys detention was not long	4.9364
i shall find many men as able as you are  i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	37.0819
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him	35.4653
have i not my talent left	26.5140
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers bed	25.2401
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	33.7762
you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	32.3144
dartagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains	15.0063
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oclock	35.9438
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saint jean aux bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest	106.4816
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian	45.2386
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to dartagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secretsonly she believed she could say she was not dead	48.4550
milady  oh yes said porthos true i had forgotten it  athos looked at him intently	56.7686
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husbanda forgiveness she was purchasing with her death	127.1530
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out	36.7823
as for eugnie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah	19.2983
we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four men  yes but to yield said porthos	60.1725
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre	47.3335
all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness	36.2774
i am not forgotten	31.7367
halloo	75.1125
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out  make ready  at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out  la bruyere and du barthois	24.6756
the man who abducted my wife  the cardinal rang a second time	25.5232
at last i mastered my agitation	16.9353
monsieur said m de trville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair  i have no objection replied m de la trmouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers  you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said trville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you  make it monsieur i listen  how is monsieur bernajoux your esquires relative  why monsieur very ill indeed	44.8636
athos raised his sword dartagnan lowered his	16.2758
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue	74.6491
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	27.9827
youre welcome sirs	1.4024
i see how it will be said athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now	24.8479
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son  and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son  no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight	42.9417
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock	26.7078
well after all said dartagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such	47.8713
athos had been out since six oclock	74.7813
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes  so you are free now and rich  alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year	315.1649
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject  a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady	33.2428
i do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind  the man looked at the bank notes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the water jug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs	41.9483
since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the wall  be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant	143.8033
50245m    the path was wide but dark	40.6247
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them	23.4925
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required	25.3985
in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap	37.3588
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands  oh the great man cried dartagnan	113.5486
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony	141.1288
nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness	64.2985
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room	134.1036
dont be afraid said dartagnan	11.8358
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man	22.2761
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	36.5723
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	78.8363
mine also are from him  indeed sir i recognize you you are captain mordaunt  mordaunt was startled	95.0259
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutesa whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticksfor following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education ie fencing boxing and single stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher	928.0256
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed  how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	43.4848
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers replied	52.8663
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed	78.6870
the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations	93.2931
do you say resumed dartagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman  i tell you i am sure of it continued the host	19.6084
where is he  in my wifes chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his wounds  his things and his bag are with him	32.3407
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des fossoyeurs near the luxembourg	5.7647
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform  no one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased	96.7592

dartagnan started on seeing these tears	52.5226
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	22.8013
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish	30.0830

besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible	42.4055
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	16.4089
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me  how dear sister said lord de winter	28.8407

the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt	34.7905

he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia	107.5966
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	38.9021

athos arrested	901.9188

for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian	92.7365
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you	25.2200

they found him up less pale than when dartagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons	68.9369

mme	83.1357

oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him  do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes  no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de saint mran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand	25.9200
diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now  then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinals door	28.6150
and you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life	14.3280
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else	56.0281
are they made to order  precisely said the count six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness	35.2509
the others followed	351.7289
thank you she said	9.0066
of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly	60.4574
the will was never wanting  to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall  tis truei said so and i say it again  and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldnt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves  that is true we should need clothes and arms  well said dartagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better  bah said porthos looking around	392.0259
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age	26.1123
oh if you know him tell me  by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple  that is he that is he but his name  ah his name	33.4914
adieu i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other  the abb with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming	194.2875
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars	69.9883
the minute hand moved on	110.0547
they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans who according to his custom affected popularity	17.0352
always the samealways the childs corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture	35.1038
thou must add said dartagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name  planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	85.5380
now then what do you say to that  alas	21.8129
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery	21.9728
milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion	34.0471
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure  it is a wound that confines him to his bed  ah and a master stroke too i assure you	80.1402
yes sdeath	458.8259
he is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the baron danglars with a fine residence in the rue du mont blanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and i know not how many millions in his strongbox  ah said the abb in a peculiar tone he is happy  happy	49.9441
mercds who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond  true said fernand	17.4517
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio	24.9292
they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words  this is the head of ali tepelini pasha of yanina  i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead	84.7253
and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you nay perhaps you will even have a double reward  i madame i cried felton	115.2631
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristos table and that of signor pastrini	8.1927
bonacieux shuddering	139.8019
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentines i am coming was the customary signal of farewell	14.0323
dants was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom	38.3682
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation  felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan	51.0660
ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they havent left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they havent left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders  no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have askedonly i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie  very well sir said the host ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain  do as you like said raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place	152.2988
in ten minutes dartagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt	10.7289
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne	7.4356
and how did it happen  i will tell you all about it replied mousqueton	20.6490
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility	22.7656
dartagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat	18.9590
on the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at surgres	11.7072
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful	33.0307
i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons	28.9693
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol	12.9332
and you responded to his bidding you imprudent man  well i cant say i had much choice of going or not going for i was taken to him between two guards	88.3305
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital  faubourg saint germain said chteau renaud	14.7423
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing  i said dartagnan nothing and he read  you have not answered my first note	35.0010
this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men	51.6668
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security	16.2964
villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness	35.2592
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	63.7292
you are late  general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me  ah	61.5928
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me  then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	35.7760
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m morrel to aid dants he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	100.3427
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window	10.0679
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring	160.1228
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full	93.3252
what is the matter my dear m mouston asked dartagnan	19.5017
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff	36.7129
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracythe greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles	212.1954
you can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathedah	61.6910
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of  what proofs do you require  did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dants  dants	26.1585
in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses	12.0303
30 monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself	35.5144

yesi should expect so besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them  the queens voice	30.0554
the queen my sister is no longer queen my child	82.0956
under the cuirass the hump will not be seen	7.5366
but fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes	41.1543
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair	22.2351
art thou a messenger from god art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or a demon callest thou thyself eloa or astarte  do you not know me felton	29.4703
but what have you done asked franz	13.9332
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room	42.4049
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	4.1663
oh yes  that is well  and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket	39.0189
de motteville will not be astonished at this reply	29.2573
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud  my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion	51.9399
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty	6.5600

only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us	52.5767
we do what we can and she rushed out of the room	40.2944
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne  and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon  perhaps returned the count smiling	93.0837
curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramiss room	258.5808
do you know what that warning was  no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal  yes thats it no doubt said milady returning the letter to mme	64.7505
good day to you have you slept well  excellently athos but what are you looking for	15.6129
youll excuse me i know  they exchanged bows and dartagnan returned to his companions	20.0030
i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself	26.5052
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot	46.7020
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges thats all but where to find this man  i know not  have you no information as to his abiding place  none	68.6513
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread  cardinal he said	21.7856
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe	23.4461
juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate	33.4276
the life of the four young men had become fraternal	20.4816
that is a large sum	16.5787
if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrotheda being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breastdo you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain  yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant  i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death	1330.5282
felton entered miladys apartment	30.4517
chapter 73 the promise  it was indeed maximilian morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day	30.1967
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	80.6401
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades	28.4206
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidlyonly they had agreed to meet once a week about one oclock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door	98.6280
his three companions joined him	19.4038

during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	70.0412
dants might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	44.3181
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs  bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs	13.9754
well i have ten thousand for you  you are not boasting  do you wish for a proof  yes  there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis	70.9264
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton	44.6723
making no reply grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid	160.9595
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions half reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind  franz essayed to smile	30.9596

in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters	35.3694

the next morning therefore when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of long live broussel long live our father resounded from all parts and was death to mazarins ears and the cardinals spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen	139.7927
dont be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house	19.4266
dants turned pale hesitated and reflected	40.6199
dartagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends	23.3022
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move	21.4561
put him to death  franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	31.4236
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime  villefort tried to smile	27.3003
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle	41.6340
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme	66.4518
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedfrom electricity lightning from lightning illumination  no replied dants	50.0989
while singing milady listened	153.0693
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m davrigny	35.3929
he bowed with great friendship to the count	37.6973
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him	57.8012
how did your father receive him albert	32.4186
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess	20.6182
the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her	26.2308
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal	27.1581
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the kings musketeers in these quarrels	44.4623
it was now athoss turn to take a sly look	22.4867
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantsthe worthy dantslook here and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor	200.8653
proceed was heard on all sides	56.4620
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time  these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo	63.2243
ma foi i havent consulted my daughter but if she has good taste  oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fathers position is good  hem said danglars	89.3975
if they had discovered miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to bthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends	74.4081
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared	75.9817
now i think of it you can do better said danglars	20.6773
monsieur dartagnan said the commissary addressing athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur  but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur dartagnan whom you show me  what	65.8738
goodnight and before dants could open his mouthbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	229.6388
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king  yes madame but on the frontier he was met by lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings	34.8396
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	27.1804
i understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de paris well we must wait  they had not long to wait	21.6930
come come choose your part replied jussac	100.6818
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier	11.3863
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you  why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the stranger	42.1940
the deuce cried dartagnan	35.4837
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and dartagnan a captain	39.0460
pardon me dartagnan he said	18.1048
an angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other  monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear	183.8046
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against sleepiness	18.1628
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honor	1140.0441
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony  really said franz	37.1005
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor	34.3162
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor	53.1037
confide in me	13.4559
it was about five oclock	31.6618
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands  you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much  you have rightly guessed madame replied the count	440.6217
the servant understood them	226.4395
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep	28.1841
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugnie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg	25.9725
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	20.3345
ten men for monsieur de comminges  as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets	43.6087
gentlemen good morning  as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage  bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m danglars  for heavens sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	64.2110
it was ten oclock when they arrived	18.2210
with your belt my lord replied la ramee	18.8152
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone	14.8240
i ask you what year is it  the year 1829 returned jacopo	36.3227
suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	67.7634
we must be expeditious	21.1215
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you	52.2163
make haste dear lodger said he there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs and you know women dont like to be kept waiting  thats kitty said dartagnan to himself and darted into the passage	38.9582
we keep him in the cellar	56.5643
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer	31.2768
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	12.5187
who has displeased you	20.7175
the abb did not know the island of monte cristo but dants knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there	46.8610
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living	30.9534
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at dartagnan who was counting on his fingers	22.9351
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name	18.7842
the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said  you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars  a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	55.7878
i like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly	35.1930
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	54.4682
another of the number continued the abb without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me  a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbs speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards	132.0301
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven	79.3766
you see said lord de winter presenting dartagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman	45.1235
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart	10.6386
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp	71.4511
 a sacerdotal officer	19.6738
so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied  m	27.3522
my only fear is the chance of dants being released	43.4990
whew	45.3722
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged	238.9680
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces	26.1026
thats love or i dont know what love is  come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but  yes said caderousse but how  my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so	39.5951
help comrades help  by a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived dants sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat	61.4135
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other  well done planchet	31.3333
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived	40.8962
dartagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dnouement of the bloody tragedy	32.3675
but we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable  for my own part i demand it said aramis	69.2881
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	12.7750
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished	57.4871
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table	16.7577
i feared it maximilian said she it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you did i not stop you at once with the word impossible morrel impossible  you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it said morrel sorrowfully	53.9357
never	42.2930
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after dartagnan	21.3053
baron danglars  follow me said the man	17.4331
oh god exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to heaven have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world  i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully i once spoke to you of four men  what can be done with four  four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time  and where are these four men  ah that is what i do not know	99.0836
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me     chapter xix	26.6052
you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers	24.3678
as to you good sir you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on that head	52.4771
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and stupid  porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew dartagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose	364.3897
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed	24.4656
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	17.9106
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus	35.4799
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us  and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling	49.8912
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	41.0474
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	13.1241
i faint	209.3266
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn	20.5687
what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him  he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian	38.9385
it is his way and you must take him as you find him  at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act	25.7276
i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman  you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal  oh no certainly not  well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me  but this secret is not mine and i cannot reveal it in this manner  you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan with chagrin	116.4831
dartagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen	16.4262
come parry said the king cease your tears  if its parry said the bishop i have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come  at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out when aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of england	154.3689
one would say you were carrying me off  and they would be right pardieu  oh i think you swore eugnie  and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	123.1622
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	79.0783
this was the costume that best became the king	113.7036
coquenard understood it	19.8901
listen said he just now i told you it was of m de monte cristo you must demand an explanation  yes and we are going to his house  reflect morcerf one moment before you go  on what shall i reflect  on the importance of the step you are taking  is it more serious than going to m danglars  yes m danglars is a money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel	28.1235
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	28.3133
this belonged to one of his friends at the caf de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of maulon 25 rue saint dominique that being the name and address on the card	59.8130
no one has brought a letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of itself  what do you mean blockhead  i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom  and where is that letter  i left it where i found it monsieur	70.5540
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters  comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview	110.3185
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony	28.0189
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak	12.0004
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer	18.7526
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it  the cardinal repressed a smile	103.2717
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger	66.3328
only that there may be no delay i shall borrow one of your horses  certainly all the four are at your service  oh i need only one of them for the time being  shall we take our valets  yes you may as well take mousqueton	90.2416
yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me but if the pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone  the poor mans eyes filled with tears	106.7614
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me  and youyou would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis	53.8051
bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day	28.8192
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	38.8267
but instead of growing easier dants pains appeared to increase in violence	31.2860
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain  and you have returned have you not replied m bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air	60.5938
ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each	33.9379
the interview for which i ask is of us two alone and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted  i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman	118.4269
why count exclaimed eugnie what has happened to your ward	44.1722
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband	15.4444
what was most clear in the matter was that dartagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all	37.6938
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt	53.1090
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way	61.5713
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits	41.2348
i cannot speak latin responded the marquise	11.6456
at five oclock anne went to the cardinals room	54.8785
we can find out his  well thats all very sensible athos said dartagnan	25.5820
that will insure his confidence  athos smiled	31.4786
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated	27.7203
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper	48.2233
well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight  at ten oclock felton came and placed the sentinel	33.0121
let us horsewhip the fine gentleman said others	47.6347
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court	23.0808
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health	33.5516
hang it said porthos	8.6048
ah yes it is indeed strange  and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	19.1795
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room	22.8024
it is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said aramis	12.9395
adieu  thus tis quite decided said dartagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you  on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i repeat i am made up of contradictions	92.9371
you are placed on high my lord but tremble	118.0668
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	54.0634
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations	30.2725
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that dartagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind	80.5989
this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn	35.9602
it was necessary to reach m de trville it was important that he should be informed of what was passing	15.4164
he was softened	82.2134
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time  however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison  no sir not at this moment at least  sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	56.1870
bassompierre and schomberg against the duc dangoulme	9.4486
you will go to marseilles said dantsfor you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them	43.1452
one day the old man fell ill and died	58.0072
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily  do you know the woman who has just entered that box  yes what do you think of her  oh she is perfectly lovelywhat a complexion	178.9361
a child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river  impossible cried madame danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child  perhaps continued villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital  oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there  i ran to the hospital and learned that the same nightthe night of the 20th of septembera child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half	297.4012
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	28.4947
she turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her	34.9768
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever	23.4563
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit  search then monsieur	57.7386
we have a king ten years old who doesnt yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farmthat is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarins hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes	157.2366
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste  then cried franz it is hashish	161.1501
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them	13.5598
franz returned to the manuscript and continued  sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou accepted	31.5054
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you  if i durst say what i believe on that head  what you believe  i ought rather to say what i know  what you know  and even what i am sure of  and of what are you so sure  i would say that i know this great lady  you  yes i  and how do you know her  oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion  speak	103.7835
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war	22.2946
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascusyou remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde	33.5219
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody  i agree monsieur but do not be too confident	59.9658
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady he almost believed in the crime of de wardes	39.9277
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	27.2896
i am dying with anxiety	19.5944
no one has seen dartagnan and porthos has not appeared	59.1712
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa	15.8749
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise  monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window	151.5879
alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you  edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming help help  faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him	41.8059
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where davrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief	9.4761
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of	39.9166
dartagnan has abducted my wife	55.9247

the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared	17.1898
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	24.4629
do not exaggerate your duty	19.8662
poor dear girl	72.3789

felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door	18.2197
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i  fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference	119.2770
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up	18.4976
the marines were removed	38.1966
where are you going marechal asked the queen	12.9275

shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron	49.3067
he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal	9.3369
you must be cruelly bored here  that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you  whats that  it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice	45.8140
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian	50.4875
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell	10.9172
for one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as i die	125.2692
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin	78.7324

on the eve of battle	4.2325
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter  strange	33.3777
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground	49.8184
well be it so said she	30.7399
mazarin replied dartagnan bursting into a laugh	35.4074
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 francs	20.4071
from congo if you will  it must be farther off than even that  but what do i know of your parisian husbands  oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race  but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray	153.9098
the duke de guise killed monsieur de coligny in the place royale and nothing was said of it  ah things go on gaily then said porthos	53.3970
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	34.8359
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors  yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone  never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling	28.2827
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all  ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear  you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough	79.7786
as to his title and fortune  as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte  upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman	63.8790

steel is for gentlemen  and seizing the butcher by the throat  porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow  porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed it	171.9293
gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw	12.1231
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth  certainly  agreeable  undeniably  witty  he has unfortunately too much wit  well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man  because he is an enemy  of whom  of the cardinal  what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man	256.0977
with such a vade mecum dartagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait	24.7797
traitors screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain	26.8469
bonacieux dartagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair	23.5610
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy	39.1925
in about ten minutes dartagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos	20.3385
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them	21.2259
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room	66.6850

it is indeed thee  yes yes constance	64.3639
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	40.7288
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me  come now said athos you are joking  in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said  i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements  no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences  poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal  come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair  perhaps you speak the truth aramis  well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	37.1955
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason	25.5699
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felices steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins	90.2201
dants was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones	98.3773
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take  i have his letters said she	58.2390
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another	29.9804
doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast	25.4041
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh	59.2745

porthos placed his hand on the pistols	18.7637
30169m    notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired	19.3018
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars	67.9766
grimaud sprang up	16.6694
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight	197.4677
now let us everyone retire to his own home said dartagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention	27.3676
what monseigneur said dartagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself	43.1346
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of trville	116.0541

and who brought you up he asked again	169.4457
in my house murmured he in my house  come magistrate said m davrigny show yourself a man as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it  you make me shudder doctor	123.5305
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind  oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you  no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to  six millions gasped danglarsso be it  then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned	697.6983
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	34.2976
porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself	46.3946
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her	16.5588
when you can find out a womans age by her face it is useless to ask it when you cannot do so it is indiscreet  is she beautiful  sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in france  this reply reassured the vicomte	43.5483
chapter 98 the bell and bottle tavern  and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune	79.5672
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis	411.3824
what will they leave him	41.2732
a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond	15.6550
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong  monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition	24.6720
what has become of him  i shouldnt wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment	16.7371
jussac fell like a dead mass	30.2442
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon  you are adorable madame  but do not keep raoul with you  why not  because he is in love  he	45.3938
they shook their heads	66.6718
i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed said cromwell staring very fixedly at mordaunt	31.7790
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	99.5810
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of dartagnan and athos	14.3497
0313m    two hours afterward dants sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht	36.3474
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi to be his guide	147.9835
that was what he could not know	19.2081

you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me	98.7114
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant	29.5496

for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal     chapter x a mousetrap in the seventeenth century   the invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days as soon as societies in forming had invented any kind of police that police invented mousetraps	41.9918
ah you frighten me	10.4835
oh spare me  that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same  m de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless	21.2948

this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal	27.3170
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased	100.9495
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty	50.0351
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore	20.0920
thanks dartagnan thanks cried aramis almost in a state of delirium	44.2454
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying  send on your business those who do theirs at the same time	20.4059
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti monte cristo was for an instant alone	42.3511

but what cared i for delays or difficulties valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me	36.1995
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her  and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian	225.2346

give your orders  have you kitchens here  kitchensof coursecomplete ones  and cooks  excellent  well a fowl fish gameit signifies little so that i eat  as your excellency pleases	11.0985
we lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life	2113.9316
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out  it would be very easy if you much wished it  how so  probably you have some correspondent in greece  i should think so  at yanina  everywhere  well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini  you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today  do so  i will  30259m    and if you should hear of anything very scandalous  i will communicate it to you  you will oblige me  danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coup	86.8950

twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with promises	41.7983
athos walked about in a contemplative mood	36.8258

never never  i believe you said mme	46.1146
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy	19.7522

now he said are you in pain  yes my head is not only swimming but burning  whats the matter with this head said dartagnan raising the battered hat	25.4895
the man made no reply	23.2285
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking	29.5339
both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them	16.0226

why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known  why so  because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields  the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	43.1137

and i also said dartagnan i also	47.0773
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majestys service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count  well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me	461.5541

look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to dartagnan the scratch he had remembered	32.3160

ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service  20093m    but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said franz	171.1402

34  oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours  do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge	31.8009
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to falluntil at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du prier	358.2757

what could this treachery be	35.7537
if i only were a  a baron dont you mean cried dartagnan finishing his friends sentence	37.7919
well laporte asked the queen	21.6763
why did you deceive me	9.7706
poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation  meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying  florentin is your horse fit to return immediately  it is a poor lame post horse  in what state was the house when you left  all was quiet but on returning from m beauchamps i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	21.3858

oh do not deny it	13.7011
at length franz arrived at the word myself	71.2526
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain	18.4064
he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow	68.5746
dartagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression	18.6196
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive  dants you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion  these words rang in dants ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength	123.3633
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful  he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne it was the point where he had embarked	63.0891

oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away  by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence	43.4924
the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment	26.6587
here is my pass countersigned said the latter	20.1403

the order was executed	122.6687
in gods name answer me  he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	77.6884

just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and monte cristo came forth	16.7711
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and dartagnan more than anyone	34.1307
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no	16.0482

well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint	43.9608
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey  and do you command nothing in your own name  in my name said mme	27.0442
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do  well it is true said anne of austria and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully	52.9517

science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them	7.0427
he must have written to him	19.1196
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is dartagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean	30.5597
do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual	9.0227
see said davrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow	39.0036
never cried dartagnan	21.8856
really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france	76.8183
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven	150.8434
where your life was spared for shame	81.2968

the brand of englandit would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of franceoh by that by that i was branded indeed  this was too much for felton	108.1024
yes he said	14.4575
adieu then and be of good courage said athos	48.9663
oh father do not look in that way at me	53.0610
he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death	54.5408

grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in peace  i doubt that replied dartagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	24.9914
then we are once more reunited said andrea	17.9831
for what purpose  upon my honor i will instantly return it to you	41.8994
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention  monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures  the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself  we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her  sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers	126.9431
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pres where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess	26.2692
he will come and visit the comte de la fere  dartagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him	23.4985
listen	13.4510
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	47.0437
if he were minister and i were his dartagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin mordieu	35.9840
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes  i do not think so my lord said bernouin but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence  tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed	40.9730
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty	37.8628
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips	40.7932
planchet said he	15.8734
he criticised everybody humorously	18.6988
she extended her hands to him with a smile	11.8544
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you  there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this	33.0386
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you  why  because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning  40254m    it is probable said albert	34.5155
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune dartagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them	76.0497

you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters  devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion  egad said dartagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing  my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebut i shoot sometimes that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits  really how very amusing  yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing  dartagnan now no longer counted the sighs	239.2656
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	30.3258
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out	39.7694
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him	33.1972
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right dont be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal	37.3449
the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down	23.3905

i could have drunk fifty bottles more  dartagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered	36.4932
oh that is very goodindeed it is very good said louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envywill they go under a mans hat like the one i see down there  you shall see said eugnie	55.6500

why it is as good as a century	15.4317
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor  20139m    under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	137.2786
are you sure you are more reasonable  yes said valentine and i have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which i had undertaken to watch  valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred  yes said valentine besides it will not be for long  she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m noirtiers room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant	41.2488
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons	15.5792
pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer	18.8132
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m noirtier  i know it is very bitter said valentine so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter	45.9761
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	78.1866
what are you doing reverend sir	7.2368
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you  you pardon me cried dartagnan	63.5035

constance constance cried dartagnan	8.1474
ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution  there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for i saw the account and copied it down  very well you can retire m bertuccio i need you no longer	93.2192

certain dants could not escape the gendarmes released him	25.2037
did he allude to his hope of being captain  he spoke of it as a thing already decided  indeed said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me  why it seems m morrel has promised him the thing  so that he is quite elated about it  why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker  which you refused  most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now m dants has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a captain  pooh said danglars he is not one yet  ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him  if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is  what do you mean  nothingi was speaking to myself	208.8865
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty	16.1693
athos did not move	19.9007
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence  aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	45.1074
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish	40.4033
i descended rapidly although i had not seen villeforts face i recognized him by the beating of my heart	42.3056
the footmans mission was an easy one	23.4887
well then said aramis	9.8521
let us go immediately  they sent for a cabriolet	25.0767
it was one of the gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty	12.4532
go  the musketeers set off and dartagnan was left alone with raoul	44.7914
in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end	56.1991
with one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet  fifty feet responded dants almost terrified	49.3387
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation	13.7153
men fell around him as they had fallen at rocroy or at lerida	24.9922
i will say  do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that andrea was moved to the very soul	28.6008
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wifes writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows  you know that i was a good mother since it was for my sons sake i became criminal	75.8429
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence	65.4607
m de villefort was as usual unmoved	8.8178
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	19.2804
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age valentine remained dumb and motionless	35.3945
a moment cried dartagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half drawn swords	29.8070
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesnt sympathize with the desires of others	169.5385
what is the use of following the alleys	28.8786
this announcement was received in silence	82.9391
chapter xvii	327.7992
there duke said he you were right and i was wrong	42.6002
i am going to prove to you that i have not  good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning  monsieur dartagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain  yes my lord  and your friend still longs to be made a baron  at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already  then said mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown dartagnan take this dispatch and carry it to england  dartagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it	58.8299
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door	29.0776
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo	24.2462
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly london sir if you please and my master lord dartagnan	84.9348
the captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so i took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then i jumped after him	92.9903
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them  very well i understand  go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business  porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	17.5996
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys	80.1532
alas	73.0036
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	38.0431
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung  true replied grimaud	22.3790
after dinner the play  monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests	37.4918
monte cristo opened the carriage door morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps	19.2996
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know  i have enemies replied dants my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	36.9206
there and elsewhere  the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity  madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	69.4677
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past	23.9449
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it	7.8458
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started	24.1517
if he were rich if he had cavalcantis fortune that might be pardoned	41.3153
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure	64.9138
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass	13.1634
mazarin breathed again	52.4228
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody	31.7324
aramis and his thesis  chapter xxvii	13.3448
but consider dartagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that bthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	78.3006
do you know his house at auteuil  certainly  what do you know respecting it  do you wish to know why he bought it  yes  the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments	44.7166
hear me maximilian said his father	42.8554
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty and she had signed it	36.1138
he might fail but something must be left to chance	108.8142
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers  yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide  willingly my lord	25.1015
another had done all this why then was it impossible to dants	66.2670
the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprisedfor in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte	49.6694
she was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with	17.7599
pray continue  well then listen	42.0504
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud  grimaud replied athos	29.8555
milady rushed to the door and opened it	14.8169
i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery	18.3159
dartagnan alone did not seem convinced	37.6303
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m de boville m morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor	159.4827
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity	31.9030

you dont do your work by halves	82.1189
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled	22.4654
did you ever hear of such an idea  monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face	33.6301
dartagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses	36.6153
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	45.8252
have you then power against death	103.6508
30341m    then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	14.3791
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth	113.8362
m de trville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip	15.7597
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror	36.8987
and now when are we to go asked athos	60.0163
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquiredehmy friend  aramis paused	98.3333
i have not tried to discover her other name  kitty cried milady	67.4244
you say you fear nothing but death  i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans  and old age  my end will be achieved before i grow old  and madness  i have been nearly mad and you know the axiomnon bis in idem	67.4546
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream	72.5743
anybody may possess a five franc piece  but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me	39.2364
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory dartagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor	41.1087
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner  in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abb busoni	61.2582
if you would but accept my offers	55.3174
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	23.9780
these arrangements made the lackeys retired	81.5881
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	34.4085
well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping a louis into his hand	24.6218
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection	107.5025
i cannot believe it murmured the banker	32.3611
i would almost answer for planchet  well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice  why good god	56.5105
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death	149.5340
take it from me when i amdead  yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis	31.7964
in that case i will forgive him  and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him	69.8211
the ancona road replied the baron	34.1782
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together	73.3577
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort  the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention	38.0227
well well said he	16.5200
the curate then entered followed by planchet	56.6263

my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious	38.2610
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed  how so asked beauchamp	32.8768
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness	14.8316
he opened his eyes	11.2506
thats more time than we want	72.6406
it is not your father or madame de villefort who is ill as for you although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field  valentine colored	33.5608
on reaching her room eugnie locked her door while louise fell on a chair	22.4353
zounds	69.4094
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street	47.0538
his itinerary was promptly determined he would go to dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward soissons the other toward compiegne there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained	195.1562
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you  30165m    noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	101.6645
dartagnan remained standing and examined this man	59.2480
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me  nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own  his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death  madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her	110.7811
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one	25.5536
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de trvilles letter and you will show your leaves of absence	43.0170
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families	23.1547
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man	15.4213
in gold silver or notes  half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat	40.6010
as to dants he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it	47.2788
another way of getting hanged  so you refuse my request  to be sure i dofuriously  the pretty landlady was desolate	19.9016
he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered  hold your tongue said danglars	10.2997
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help	24.2556
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos	22.1964
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge  then you disapprove of duelling	41.4893
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another  what is that  break his armwound himbut do not kill him  i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i  and you  that will be another thing i shall be brought home  no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings	191.8410
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	215.3517
we and his majesty will lead the second	90.9938
you see said dants quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage	34.0066
this evening then at nine oclock  adieu till then  notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared	57.0713
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree  heavens athos a murder cried dartagnan	42.7866
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction  an admirable subject cried the jesuit	52.3156
is it you baron said he	26.8288
the diamond which glittered in the window at marls or fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure  worldling murmured the count	582.0252
ma foi yes though he was in his own element  what do you mean  the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists  great is truth muttered the count fire cannot burn nor water drown it	26.8799
50239m    ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed	56.1334
once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all	528.2393
you know it is not my fault said morrel	15.4736
someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here  that who was here  your childyour sonyour andrea  i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness	74.1711
the moment for my escape is fixedseven oclock	37.5443
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my earsassassinated i have assassinated then and not executed	55.7113
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers	40.6365
and perhaps his saddle therewith  no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos	40.6913
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment	131.3674
why  i do not know	7.7549
how convenient that theres a bench here	56.7121
does madame de morcerf dance  never you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation  indeed  30283m    yes truly and i assure you	30.7532
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords  but it was too late	8.4034
tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue	23.8904
with five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year  a garden with two acres of land  and a thousand francs a year  oh heavens  come take them and monte cristo forced the bank notes into his hand	84.6498
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards  no said the count i was making a suit  how said albert	24.7542

we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk	25.7205
oh indeed i cannot permit you to go  is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear  ill tell you answered the countess	61.4949
prison had made edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever	54.7341
that can only be to hold gloves he said	39.0495
yours will be returned to you tomorrow	42.4720
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet	17.7814
the womans hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face	18.5744
alas said athos we depart alone  yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation  we are not yet at our destination observed the prudent dartagnan beware of misadventure  ah my friend cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens	87.4952
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris	18.4298
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch	45.5818
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you	49.9421
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	48.2300
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look	25.1735
i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account	37.4421

mme	98.5736
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming	44.7580
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz dpinay to pass a fortnight at venice	19.8526
peppino mounted the seat behind	32.2524
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation  why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do	117.7581
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet	41.2105
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	148.7979
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husbands strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan	83.4943
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him	46.4427
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back	29.2892
a surgeon reverend sira surgeon said caderousse	9.3170

where is athos  in the cellar monsieur  what you scoundrel	50.5676
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the garteri said to myself my fortune is made	33.6778
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her	35.5310
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth  he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought dartagnan	127.9505
no country can say it saw my birth	166.5358
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos	19.1154
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting	19.5415
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them	22.1098
the queen was still standing when he entered but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here  to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers  how monsieur an investigation of my papersmine	82.8153
i will be an abb if it suits me	18.4586
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances	71.6355
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friendyou can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction	86.2139
if you could but persuade him to come out monsieur i should owe you the gratitude of my whole life i should adore you as my patron saint  then he is there	56.9576
bazin my friend come here  the door opened and bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair	37.3704
why did you not have him arrested while in paris  arrest the duke	32.1501
he followed him	38.5500
he clung to one ideathat of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante	221.1752
oh	62.5356
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly	14.5703
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	18.3256
the following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count	18.1152
undeceive yourself comrade you are not monsieur de trville  my faith replied dartagnan recognizing athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own apartment	45.2044
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome	26.1369
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first	27.3972
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise  some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide  no no continued dartagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman	520.6653
what prevents you from being so  oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars  marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders	134.4767
listen	76.5583
charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for juxon then for martyrdom	20.9465
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel	14.7564
he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it	30.8451
ah dont be angry i beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me	34.0030
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places	19.9408
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide  prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron grasp	63.7682
halloo	44.5803
shoulder muskets	1.6358
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks  where can i sleep  on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you likewe can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars  as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition	383.0386
thats well	11.7873
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	42.8339
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal	29.2180
butformerlyit appears began mousqueton timidly	39.2085
the abb took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond	115.9859
but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	28.5641
i fell upon one knee then upon both	88.2790
that pretty little soubrette whom dartagnan had already observed then came in	50.2440
to know what  the name of the owner of the winning horse  excessively only imaginebut do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no  i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not	38.5923
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton	59.2435
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced	72.7277
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil  he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him	300.4746
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird	28.0370
that nobleman was you it was his father  hush	86.2417
it was danglars letter to the kings attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson  french had taken from the file against edmond dants on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m de boville	29.5689
neither mercds nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other	37.6647
and now monsieur du verger he said shut yourself up with this man until monsieur bernouin returns to open the door	29.4349
her ladiesthat is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sensehad just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	56.2611
fire then when the shot was fired	34.4514
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons	37.8012
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said  come aramis now for the honor of france and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded	167.9094
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too	40.2448
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m de villefort     chapter 52 toxicology  it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion	44.7913
poor woman	17.1710
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me  if my society would not be disagreeable  be it so	48.2526
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him	30.4537
since my brothers assassination in the streets of nmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard	56.6079
we will talk italian and spanish	73.8984
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they cannot touch  edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and joy	109.8728
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage	9.7062
fight on all occasions	31.6050
for a long time a gun had been the young mans greatest ambition	19.7181
read and answer or i will blow out your brains  the sergeant saw that dartagnan was in earnest	33.6836
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer	64.5382
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns	24.3157
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs lyses to the house of monte cristo	29.2849
such are for royalty and we are simple commoners  speak not of crowns	49.3194
they resumed their route	31.1424
no no be easy on that score	20.8880
no one has come out he replied	49.1584
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king  ah you knew that said mordaunt	26.8177
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill  very probably answered the count	44.2409
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house  valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event  what voices asked valentine	103.6505
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	66.8073
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy  at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother  ah excuse me then said dartagnan	80.0240
ah my headoh what agonyshall i suffer like this long  no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer  ah i understand you said the unhappy man	64.5435
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts	50.7141
we shall try to persuade the great daguesseau11 m de villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him  never despair of anything says the proverb  do you dance count  i dance  yes you it would not be astonishing  that is very well before one is over forty	51.2765
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue	39.6064
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london	27.5639
their return was cheerful	126.5329
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	24.8318
who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams	18.0066
yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement	44.9977
what do you prescribe doctor demanded villefort	9.9745
anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash	82.1374
a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain	34.6608
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneys general and bailiffs	17.3437
chapter 25 the unknown  day for which dants had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned	44.2359
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another	25.4917
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet	54.4315
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber	31.8134
how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin	25.2832
well said the president your name  i cannot tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my fathers and can tell it to you  a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand	21.5813
aramis obeyed	247.8007
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible	22.4569
on your brow i read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidingsyour hands tremble	15.1626
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows  madame and most faithful wife  debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes	61.5782
now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you  oh cried eugnie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me	74.5820
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean dartagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	14.4390
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	9.6639
four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles  yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles  a pistole is not enough said dartagnan tis worth a louis  what is worth a louis  four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis  four hundred said porthos	213.8710
how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation	28.2361
what is to happen said porthos	43.8466
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side	21.4594
ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made	18.4480
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens	10.3039
for me said dartagnan are you sure of that  pardieu monsieur i cant be more sure	26.8383

alas	72.3398
he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom	157.1085
you yourself gave me this comb  i was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders  the duke looked furiously at grimaud	53.3207

pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace	141.9119

as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign	32.7326
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	55.8272
dartagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground	29.8612
aramis blushed	43.0125
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you  heyday cried dartagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell whos an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman	37.5015
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and davrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayhe is mad  but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	176.4538
free without my aid	80.5542
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria	27.4213
they had seen no one	27.9644
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget  i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said hayde quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here  on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cristo	1343.6101

directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m danglars trembled too  morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this cannot be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartismi mean about the year 1815  yes replied m danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner  indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine  oh such a dreadful thing that i dont dare to tell you  always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile	196.4917

i felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent	33.9940
monsieur	62.4307
it was like having a spy in the enemys camp	41.4271

milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	24.5182

people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it  porthos arrived a minute after dartagnan	90.7993
we are all mortal my poor friends  you are late my dear porthos  yes there were some people on the way who delayed me	41.4707
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	31.7374
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment	11.0264
from two oclock till five franz and albert followed in the fte exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	107.7631
well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak  i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament  with which you are at waris it not so	39.7016
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur dartagnan say a great deal about them  you know monsieur dartagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes	79.1259
it would quite cut me up  you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus	71.8348
and why if you knew me do you let me die  because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal	47.3286
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman  there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it  you know his business here then  pardieu he has come to draw but i dont know how much  you will know presently my friend  very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day  what do you meanof whom do you speak	228.1559
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with tears	42.8376
but who told you i was inactive  butif the plot had succeeded  i wished it to do so  i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england  yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold  why so asked mordaunt	80.0711
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity	39.1328
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below	6.0729
we must inform the queen  ah my faith yes said porthos and dartagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now  inform the queen said athos and how	25.0416
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy	30.4311
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk	62.0874
i will join you again at marseilles  well be it solet us part said mercds folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere	48.4105
no i am wrong	26.3161
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it  at what hour shall we come asked the young man	42.1037

foolish creature he exclaimed	9.2016
this man was the executioner	31.0167
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this  friends answered charles sadly i have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom i shall never forget	49.9989
is this the decanter you spoke of asked davrigny	140.5132
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	31.3340
but know you who he was  he used to be the headsman of bethune  you knew him	44.9101
chapter 97 the departure for belgium  a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests	131.4279
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	17.7299
but the skilful manner in which dants had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the chteau dif and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery	123.2747
the drop of water  chapter lxiv	22.0724
rochefort obeyed and retired	19.3237
dartagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver	10.4774
who knows	25.8188
it must have been charming indeed	29.5704
silence said dartagnan pressing her hand still more warmly	13.4776
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired	29.5162
now mousqueton he said i hope you dont mean to desert your master  ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army	57.2660
and why not asked the young man	9.6347
de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment	71.9616
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father  see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses  indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent	45.1332
speak said athos	8.5487
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor	7.9627
and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece	23.4983
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination	20.4531
all the same i should like to do him that servicewhat do you say to it  i will tell the coadjutor said bazin	21.4963
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband  well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him  alas	49.7857
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at least	22.9331
but pray sit down  thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	19.0569
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary	36.4067
he is not dead then  no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood	52.3137
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	28.2875
what do you demand  that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	14.9312
yes  her hand exclaimed everyone	681.1365
dants cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves	47.0548
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise	23.1987
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie  be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man	75.5191
trville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships	66.8840
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow	47.8124
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feareddartagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreusehe may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about  but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle  i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away  the devil	71.6686
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me	27.9988
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs  oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	23.3522
the countess g insists upon it that he is a vampire  then the countess g has returned to paris has she inquired the baroness	18.6727
te deum for the victory of lens	3.8208
i know nothing  can you not understand that monsieur dartagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence  truly  do you not perceive that i know allyour abduction from the little house at st germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this moment	64.0996
oh	89.0815
you are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her	75.5215
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr oreilly	25.8358
chapter lxiii	97.7828
comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor	19.7838
it was evident that the abb limited himself to objects of strict necessity	15.8192
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity	31.1402
pardieu cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing  the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa	92.7916
here is one he said	32.1564
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	11.4920
come let us see what you will do for me  everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply	34.6684
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	46.2074
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	10.6639
we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are  just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said	25.6306
the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts approach	16.0078
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself  hear me count replied dartagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts  i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur dherblay	126.0998
that shoots me said the swiss	18.4607
if i am killedwell then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes  it is well replied mercds with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion  but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy	77.4875
in the name of heaven cried the poor tutor	11.7871
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents	60.7933
good caderousse he said how happy you will be  i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife	25.0989
athos turned pale	56.0195
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentines room opened and monte cristo reappeared	10.9248
caderousse had once more parted with his treasurethe banknotes were replaced in the pocket book the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard	29.2899
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before	17.9753
why  just remember what they said	94.6073
my sword is shorter than yours its true but bah	53.4521
alas	35.1139
with forty five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six monthsyou with your music and i with my voicewe shall double our capital	55.9274
the flight	1912.8595
yes said dants do you know him  no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators  0103m    it is a conspiracy then asked dants who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm	34.7711
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place	18.9501
as you see my health is but indifferent	63.6310
the young and high spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath	28.7727
at three oclock came two companies of the guards one french the other swiss	34.8900
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1e8	25.4350
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time	72.4437
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape dartagnan appeared to authorize the issue	48.1939
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel	36.4282
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail	27.2062
morrel looked around uneasily	20.4764
i thought i saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream	15.3084
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily	13.6543
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justicethy words are words of gold     chapter xx	25.2864
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other	16.3882
if you can my dear dartagnan answer for mademoiselle  oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris  then said aramis this falls out very well  he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty	48.1161
on what was dartagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling	37.7413
she fainted	1081.0284
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	107.6358
have you any money  the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful	21.7528
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room	67.4473
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the htel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son i now remember having had the honor of meeting you  i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the htel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before  it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count	161.4785
tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging  four men prepared to do so	45.6379
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer	22.6192
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is monsieur dartagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women	51.1539
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point	50.7952
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person	75.4178
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking	38.6485
the young counts conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	103.3363
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	60.6473
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	165.0775
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	64.6034
ah	55.0019
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de mdicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik  that is just said richelieu	24.0575
you were saying madame  i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor  impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others	23.8330
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at crvecur	42.7500
besides my friend dartagnan has something to say to me privately have you not dartagnan  dartagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine	28.8099
the scheme goes forward it seems  on wheels dear friend  good	46.8124
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	36.5077
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs	34.2029
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but to day is not the proper time to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman  at the first words of this address dartagnan had seized porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	93.5989
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue	18.2711
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris	58.5763
the swiss became as purple as a peony	22.1222
one thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders	33.9804
faith	51.4084
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances	34.6116
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak  go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling	231.4221
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devotee	73.7051
i am in a hurry to begin	14.4982
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	23.0192
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her	35.0609
my safety is now a mere question of speed  at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnire	24.0754
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her  dartagnan then related the poisoning of mme	72.3635
adieu madame	23.0111
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind	14.1532
one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said porthos	46.1247
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch	58.1998
i wont have him killedi wont	15.0303
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened	20.7871
my friend said he here is a proof of it  40176m    albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	16.4190
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors	10.5713
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches	33.7239
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you	19.8433
this cannot be the establishment of athos	30.4019
whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis	30.4585
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a parti colored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue	157.8847
he replied however in a tone of deep interest  i entreat you m de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputys ears	48.6877
oh he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans	16.7060
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows	17.6559
well then the place  will the place royale suit you asked dartagnan	28.1044
well while i was watchingnot the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me illwhile i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was	115.9664
am i not right m de chteau renaud  40252m    that is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn  thank you gentlemen replied albert with a smile of indifference i shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france	57.8417
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers  you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs  my friends will submit them	66.9004
he awaited mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	59.4424
milady recoiled uttering a cry	9.8475
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the rue la fayette	12.2610
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	48.9698

no sir but i am severely  what can we do said dartagnan we must return to paris  i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again	31.8740
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to dartagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him	110.0995
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask	19.1906
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table	34.8690
he took the arm of chteau renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins	21.4095
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock i shall see what color his is  then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp	74.8112
tis not too warm to walk resumed dartagnan	66.9074
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances	31.1610
without doubt she murmured	49.9058
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it  i cried dartagnan i doubt what you say	35.8840

no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowling piece powder and shot dants declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude	143.3472

the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de trvillethe counsels being thrown into the bargain	35.8430
tis then all settled	157.8102
now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep  beauchamp left the box perfectly amazed	131.6477
bravery is always respected even in an enemy	21.1907
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished m de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor	19.8589

this was now all changed	105.6027
ah	48.0616
what can have happened then to bragelonne  let him enter cried dartagnan let him come up  but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it	69.7449
as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it	35.7427
come continued dartagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice	36.0236
two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them	20.2137
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them	19.9274
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband  your husband has none	19.0048
a gentleman in his opinionand according to dartagnans portrait of him the stranger must be a gentlemanwould be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter	21.2722
chapter 50 the morrel family  in a very few minutes the count reached no	50.4592
and the edicts	224.4008
dants had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his feet	18.5322
seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited	18.2508
he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man	44.7626
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell	52.1535
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting  i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner  is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked athos	18.9644
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel  is it a very beautiful vessel  i would not wish for a better to sail round the world  of what burden is she  about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather	69.4401
she has been dead a year and you know fernand i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity	28.3158
i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant  and that is the very thing that alarms me returned dants	22.6411
tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it	66.6080
and this room he asked pointing to the captains cabin	38.6418
but why should i meddle in the matter	23.0330
monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m dessessart captain of the guards as well as the others	63.3602
dartagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility	22.7699
come in my braves said the king come in i am going to scold you  the musketeers advanced bowing dartagnan following closely behind them	29.6185
do you bring me tidings of my guardian  have you not received any said dartagnan to the youth	26.0541
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	18.1870
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was mme	18.2655
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	62.5151
nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich  indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable  poor count	61.3639
chapter 81 the room of the retired baker  the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in rue de la chausse dantin	61.0709
i mean the russian prince who you said had 30000 livres and we only found 22000  you must have searched badly  luigi vampa himself searched  in that case he must either have paid his debts  a russian do that  or spent the money  possibly after all  certainly	140.8602
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars	26.8634
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder	22.3844
old dants who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleons downfall	45.3055
yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	23.7344
the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights	43.8133
years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present	49.2122
ali brought in the coffee	62.0373
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival	189.0241
who goes there was asked a second time	31.2060
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	22.3403
i know them by their romantic imagination	23.2040
his next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap	74.7168
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him	14.3989
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape	27.2570
he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak	17.0565
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	19.5820
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to dartagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	53.5509
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized	24.9107
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society  of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne	31.6327
m de trville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist though	16.8577
this reasoning seemed to dartagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight oclock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate	95.9927
courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of la pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence	89.9727
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking	48.3025
this is torture to me cried athos	32.6028
egad	90.2359
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest	23.4539
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach	18.7687
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondys coachman	21.8210
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know you	20.1196
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic  and what do you know of him  nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse  what makes you think so  on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday i said this mass again  and his name  maillard but i do not think it is his right one  and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post  certainly  let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true treasure  gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate	98.0960
bernouin introduced him	5.8231
then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing	35.1286
i told you so exclaimed madame de villefort	22.0085
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven	29.1059
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten	7.5562
it was the plan of alexander vi	10.9778
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the alles de meilhan belonged dants next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given	91.7021
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	31.0271
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained	23.1829
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	59.3624
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him	16.4847
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by chteauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nmes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings  in the smuggling line said monte cristo	19.8230
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	97.5198
what do you say  i say that it was you who gave me the wine i say that it was you who desired me to drink it	14.6524

chteau renaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain do not pay any attention to him countlive in the chausse dantin thats the real centre of paris  boulevard de lopra said beauchamp the second floora house with a balcony	49.2374
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced	23.5589
i think so answered albert in a firm tone	21.3897
he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion	47.2909
they set out	11.5676
chapter xxxv	75.7712
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nmes	62.3801
no nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them	19.6443
we will explain in a few words how dartagnan had been led to choose that place of residence	40.2166
in which we hear tidings of aramis	29.1262
he fell back cursing with rage	11.4085
i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	31.7491
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting  oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers	66.8830
on these days he spoke a little	41.0522
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him	14.3839

they passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fitted up drawing room	42.0691
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	24.4868
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton  how can you doubt it sir	35.7060
in two or three hours thought dants the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm	77.2294
the deliberations had already begun	41.5867
albert related it to his mother chteau renaud recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the counts courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	117.1082

the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands had doubled pomgue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board	345.8082
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely	28.5727
the door closed and dants advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness	38.4862
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which dartagnan traveled	22.0037
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere  yes sire replied athos	16.4892

he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him	36.6364
in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs	14.5068
i will make you another offer  what is that  i do not offer you a million because i have it not but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercds at the catalans and give her two lines from me  0120m    if i took them and were detected i should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred  well said dants mark this if you refuse at least to tell mercds i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool  threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad	57.0513

a moment after caderousses face appeared at the grating in the door	29.9798
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friendspoor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	46.6227
the perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint	15.4383

i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day	25.7349
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away	16.2252
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter  after all the disclosures which were made this morning m noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m franz dpinay	32.1413

he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry iv	17.2813
yes yes yes continued the old man	11.4483
the comte de la fere cannot be far off only the doors are locked  that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders  for gods sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve	73.0350
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical	38.0542
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners  you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey  it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad  and you are not so any longer  no captivity has subdued mei have been here so long  so longwhen were you arrested then asked the inspector	183.6226
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him	43.8975
the servant announced m albert de morcerf	48.7513
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence  how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine	80.1586
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table	62.4788
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	37.4954

to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair	72.5111
this insolent boy chastises others cried he and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before  will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his brow	88.5591
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics	38.0136
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive	48.6206
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous tone	62.5855
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust	29.2065
come said monte cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again maximilian  yes for i begin to suffer again  the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation	44.7147
look emmanuel then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill albertthe unhappy youth has a mother  you are right said monte cristo and i have none these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder	55.6350
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds  ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies	43.3246

the king went away enchanted	48.7122
but peppino did not answer	38.0671
do you hear  well well rejoined the leader theres no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for	58.0301
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette rue tiquetonne and there await me  thats agreed said porthos	13.3633
in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies  what then is it  a skilful preparation of my friends the worthy abb adelmonte who taught me the use of it  oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable anti spasmodic  perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and i frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence	143.1209
you shall be my body guard	55.8953
i understand answered porthos i understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it but what will people say  let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it  but who will distribute these things asked porthos	73.7202
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	68.4389
i saw her this morning and bade her adieu  have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired maximilian in a faltering voice	39.7112
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses	43.5001
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison  50170m    oh pardon me sir let me live  she is cowardly said villefort	29.9543
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed	35.1213
but there must be some cause for this strange scene  the count of morcerfs adventure exasperates the young man  have you anything to do with it  it was through hayde that the chamber was informed of his fathers treason  indeed said morrel	20.5632
how grateful will m de villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child	48.6282
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs lyses on the 26th of may at seven oclock in the evening and demand of him your father	9.5759
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl	33.0945
so now i breathe againi am happy  dont be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed dartagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering	57.7793
it was very polite of you  come said andrea what do you want  you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend that is not righttake care or i may become troublesome  this menace smothered the young mans passion	25.4916
30  yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it  possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior	68.0957
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo	20.9609
dants sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him	7.6571
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded madeleines brother entered dartagnans service	63.7956
will you dine with me asked harrison of dartagnan	39.6973
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive  and once more he bowed low before his highness	71.1122
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word	35.8217
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	48.6696
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time	242.8066
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions	17.5293
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him	53.0986
by the lord my good host	93.6656
no no she answered i would rather remain here  are you really frightened madame said monte cristo	28.9374
i can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject	43.8970

sign my lord sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke	20.4867
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet	19.2407
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athoss  aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athoss residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin	91.1696
try porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows	43.9721
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor davrigny	39.9198
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazins house	20.3478
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown  i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered	337.6023
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint mrans	80.5935
the count again refused	88.8136
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose	39.4108
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey	45.3237
mme	69.6557

why it is a rank of itself in france and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year  a hundred thousand francs	35.8952
let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her secret	103.2894
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance	44.2960
this movement was observed by mordaunt	44.2999
why not  because he is an actor in the drama  has he assassinated anyone then  no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him	24.5569
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop	30.5900
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille  let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening	119.5024
who goes there cried a hoarse voice	18.8133
and king charles is well as i have just heard  he is dead my lord said aramis	21.3682
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinals cap then he added  so my friend its your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape  thats my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it	90.3431
really my lord you are his nightmare  the duke smiled with bitterness	15.5802
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	89.1881
yes do said the duchess	61.9438
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street	10.1071
as for myself i can assure you of one thingthe more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation  i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch  listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other	124.9074
but at daybreak he awoke	52.1932
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother	18.8497
why people jest with death  and people are wrong dartagnan for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation  granted but if you please let us not theologize aramis	115.4734
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	31.4121

ho	95.5841

my faith replied dartagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts  in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward dartagnan stood quite astonished	105.8109

m de monte cristo has only shown us kindness	18.0629
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility	79.2500
unfortunately said monte cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck  poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts  indeed said danglars becoming pale	149.7548
oh i see you prefer peregrination	19.7727
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo	43.9386

chapter 77 hayde  scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural	118.4447
and will you not torment me any more  never  caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change	38.9465

then dants rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	91.2652
thats all plain enough	29.6387
i know him well there	94.6744
at length the hour drew near	21.6674
captivity the fourth day   the next day when felton entered miladys apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends	43.9580
but she had her son	83.4741
i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major  and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	42.3402
there is but little reason why i should delay you	41.4146
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart	28.6612
well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces  a quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know i dont like quarrelers  and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault  what have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow	104.3276
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole  good	41.5488
i am weeping with joy  he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard	101.8599
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially	52.0535
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry  true said andrea	30.0316
had we not better lower our heads  in truth murmured dartagnan to whom m de trvilles recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid and he put his horse into a trot	79.8880
this fashion is coming in	30.8611
he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night thats all	16.8619
he took to his heels and was soon at m de trvilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de trvilles office	33.9870
noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	8.2614
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercds had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	311.0654
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound	16.0214
what to me were all the treasures in the world or all the kings of the earth	40.2826
now said dartagnan for the actual man	22.6778
mazarin pretended to laugh	16.7438
now as ever i am nothing but your servant then turning to his men  allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the duc de beaufort  long live the duc de beaufort cried the sentinels	85.5654
qui vive he asked	4.5295
i do nothing without her commandspray understand that not like monsieur de richelieu who went on just as he pleased	40.5422
but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m morrel had agreed to meet him	33.9319
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	28.7116
hey	97.2952
now if you will come on board m morrel said dants observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo m danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular	35.9058
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same	31.3045
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in	43.1017
oh yes it is she  a voice of strange sweetness  how do you know it  the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid	41.5364
how should he have been otherwise	34.8644
dont laugh my friend cried dartagnan for heavens sake dont laugh for upon my soul its no laughing matter  and he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror that athos eagerly seized his hand crying are you wounded my friend	93.7567
avenged yourself said the baron	9.8740
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	9.0809
everything is paid replied the host and liberally	35.0736
if so you can spare yourself the trouble  no said mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other  then what may it be  to call for monsieur le coadjuteur  the coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker	97.8745
but after all asked porthos who is milady  a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	28.3340
she would not be weary thank god	30.3665
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	38.0327
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit	31.8439
really my dear grard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men	55.0952
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow	101.6229
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet and if i am taken i will swallow it  well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said dartagnan	33.6274
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded	14.7876
listen to me	3.7776
he tore his hair	43.5783
the count cried a young voice that made athos start	61.0911
did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it  but what danger threatens him then emmanuel she asked	24.6328
except your signature and your partners m morrel  and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience  a cloud passed over danglars brow	89.9204
before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die	41.6517
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you	23.3226
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dants saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	23.6750
towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached	59.8485

two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead	22.4518
whom do i see yonder  where  in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a cloak  it is he cried dartagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man	63.1511
read  this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe	21.1588
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspiresis not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon	51.2727

the superior met her milady showed her the cardinals order	95.8350
at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light	7.5150

you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live	43.8804
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail	33.1601
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	23.7419
stand aside he cried stand off the road  what do you want asked a voice	22.6992
12 rue des fossoyeurs	2.1145
so you are not a mazarinist	16.2000
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body  i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign  madame replied dartagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so	187.5859
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once	79.6334
the glance was of sublime eloquence	86.1950
one of the culprits will be mazzolato3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity	20.1142
i kiss your hands	86.5264
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	42.8968

bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag  the cardinals cried dartagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife	137.8377
ah	88.5114
for him those ten minutes were very long	57.1380

i shall hear from you  yes  thanks thanks dear love adieu  the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue	61.1044
m	12.4123

they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million	56.5625
besides we will have no words about it	38.6860
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family	20.2920
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty  oh a letter	65.5294
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	66.0152
it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the htel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns	13.2750

upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar	13.8733
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	13.2496
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos	23.0946
yes  what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer	22.8605
mdah was standing at the rack eating his hay	7.6424
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground	38.2644
dartagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the rue cherish midi or chase midi as it was then called	60.9011
it was alas	91.8666
dartagnan rose and taking a letter from his writing desk presented it to raoul	22.8234
what was the matter with you baron dartagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal	14.1081
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited	62.3524
the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep	20.9285
while the struggle between day and night lasted dants still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	55.6932
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercds who must believe him dead	22.2911
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other	26.2074
you understand dants relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive  so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience	121.0030
who are you  i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the chteau dif	22.2809
but he has wealth i believe already  doubtless he has	72.7288
i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealers	18.5492
you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days	18.1562
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary  zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter  he opened a drawer and took out a purse	177.8010
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort levque	39.5168
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury	34.3689
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment	17.1485
my god	23.5339
porthos and i will stay here  the friends obeyed	30.4058
he came down into the kitchen where your doublet was	46.0274
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line	92.5534
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief	34.3713
monsieur said morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me  yes monsieur you are aware from whom i come  the house of thomson  french at least so my cashier tells me  he has told you rightly	53.7160
the confidence with which dartagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister	33.7480
of what consequence replied milady	66.8137
it was the queen	13.9878
dartagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass fall	27.5313
bonacieux was	23.8279
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu	22.2352
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter	45.8562
the prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court  but richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy	106.6335
but she was greatly embarrassed	42.2921
well well my dear edmond continued the owner dont let me detain you	17.4117
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself	38.7692
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites	53.4933
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the baron	42.9185
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling	56.5313
the workmen	848.7756
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they cannot or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks	239.0985
yes no doubt	39.2000
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil	65.3096
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle	139.9864
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman  that he may be at ease  is that all  he will know what that means  he will guess at least	39.3804
whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him	25.5582
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond studs	15.6046
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries  well well	29.9036
and now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn	41.7544

when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are	36.3104
besides this time my visit has a motive  milady trembled she thought felton had told all	53.4111
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne	31.2224
and her mother madame de saint remy have they yet told her of it  no sir madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans	45.3347

in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced	53.4964
i am brother to parry his majestys lackey  athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings tent	135.8507
i was going about at random inquiring of everybody when i saw you gallop past	42.4555
the only thing that astonished dartagnan was that his friends had never thought of this	37.6126
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	102.1096
egad cried dartagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here  the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten everything  bah said dartagnan they will have left a chicken at least he dismounted and knocked on the door	57.5664

benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands they are ready to open for youmake use of them	25.2331
the devil take this gout  athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	49.7292
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one  perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against him  well well returned m morrel we shall see	54.5384
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemans side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	57.7531
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit	38.3958
to the champs lyses said the general the count of monte cristos	11.8267
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow	19.0579
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin  perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself  to them or to us do you mean aramis  to no one	138.2779
yes sir replied franz	15.8379
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth  and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it  and here the look of the abb becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse	76.2989
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion  aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	54.5279
morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six	30.2175
what	63.9265
what for five years he had been wantinga faithful servant a friend a helping handseemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least	22.0674
i said the novice	57.0196
ah why were you not there gentlemen	109.5978
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	14.0140
think of it sire	26.5512
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her	44.1210
ah i confess your excellency when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my eyes filled with tears	17.5386
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits  therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion	21.1686
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers  go cornlie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer  cornlie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray	40.0724
we will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so  you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice	241.1009
is monsieur dartagnan there  yes madame in your oratory	87.9706
by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write	31.0002
if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is derived from texts not protected by us copyright law does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges	14.1588
dartagnan lost no time in useless compliments	53.6422
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst dartagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis	91.4881
he	36.5404
what for	512.2508
what design can i have  why then not let me out by the door  what would be the advantage of waking the porter  ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead  i wish what god wills  but swear that you will not strike me as i go down  cowardly fool  what do you intend doing with me  i ask you what can i do	180.2949
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love  my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this	145.0523
allegro he called out to the postilions at every ascent	15.3390
but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp	105.0731
de wardes one of the cardinals men a cousin of rochefort	30.4466
to be named the just  you are right trville but they were not alone your musketeers	69.8608
valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs	21.9706
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion	13.6432
m de villefort entered followed by barrois	15.8556
and her son  florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same  come this way monte cristo took bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward	96.9511
women	16.8036
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared	55.0606
captivity the fourth day  chapter lvi	11.3248
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans  we have no need therefore to say that dartagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place	173.1954
i desire to know what is the meaning of this  be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars	23.4261
yes  what is it  have you confidence in me  give your orders said the three musketeers	35.2694
chapter 18 the treasure  when dants returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking composed	64.0552

it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not  nearly  it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp	20.6303
well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond	67.6734
rinse the glasses said grimaud	30.2900
what is yonder cried dartagnan	33.6863
fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars	11.7861
they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village the red tiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an augustine brother	56.4843
of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are mademoiselle eugnie danglars and mademoiselle louise darmilly	29.7147
do you understand it now  athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmens clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and dartagnan a hammer and some nails	36.0202
debray had told you  ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation  i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now  then you are wrong madame	33.5817
beware	63.7860
this look told him all and his anger waxed hot	52.0635
before or after whichever you please  opposite the scaffold  the scaffold forms part of the fte  count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo  but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count	796.9868
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on	191.1551
do as i do	39.0490
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison  ah monsieur de rochefort	17.8579
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky	17.8132
you are strong among the strong mordaunt he said and the frenchmen how did they behave  most fearlessly  yes yes murmured cromwell the french fight well and if my glass was good and i mistake not they were foremost in the fight  they were replied mordaunt	83.8127
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission  and then  instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself	31.3909
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the kings closet opened and m de trville saw m de la trmouille come out	15.5414
why what good would it do asked caderousse	100.6010
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped	31.3854
and you believe he died  of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse	55.4292
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin  just like the women replied dartagnan coolly	56.0438
follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance	20.2331
and what friends awaited him without	78.6520
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	49.8508
indeed said athos	10.3142
and i keep my word	40.0949
no but my mother as a child saw her	68.5421
what is this  it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms  in your armsthat man	28.0500
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty	32.0486
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place i must speak to monsieur de trville on an affair of importance	128.4940
i thought i did not mistake	24.7173
valentine	54.3286
thats a different thing yes i know there are traditions of that sort said comminges	28.8250
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	25.4336
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort	18.6340
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his fathers grave  but then he had the woman he loved still remaining  you are deceived morrel that woman  she was dead  worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed	101.6061
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope	22.1417
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity	30.7912
i am called louis the just monsieur de trville and by and by by and by we will see  ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty  wait then monsieur wait said the king i will not detain you long  in fact fortune changed and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagneif we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance	159.4621
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	32.5950
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	208.9518
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track	50.0976
50039m    oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret	58.7146
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept	46.6511
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass	20.0884
relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it  have you not taken a bastion said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass	56.6244

morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord	23.7467
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents	21.4492
open sir she said and look for yourself  mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	60.8969
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully equipped	42.6326
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return	40.5161
they both stood in amazement at the door	19.2390
and now he said when he saw that dants had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself dants obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following  0245m    this 25th day of april 1498 being invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi and fearing that notcontent with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and reserves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisonedi declare to my nephew guido spada my sole heir that i have buried in a place he knows and has visited with me that is inthe caves of the small island of monte cristo all i possessed of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems that i aloneknow of the existence of this treasure which may amount to nearly two millions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth rock from the small creek to the east in a right line	123.8846
the wretches were dancing	91.8952
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words  oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature	31.2969
oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance	21.8551
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone	32.3510
but this year continued the horticulturist ill take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe  monte cristo had seen enough	63.8131
the prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse	15.8219
at that moment dartagnan opened his eyes	10.3153
be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the cellar	46.4363
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity	72.5317
and youwhat are you doing here replied dartagnan	14.8424
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him	25.7295
lovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios mercds boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips	9.4705
upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair	34.8592
this time dartagnan was not hasty	26.7682
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign	32.2630
dartagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour	112.6692
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket	49.9063
from that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet  the abb uttered a kind of groan	52.7718
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people	34.3760
chapter xlviii	46.4610
in fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	35.4965
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	19.6006
oh mon dieu he said raising his fine eyes to dartagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me  he left four days ago said dartagnan	24.9083

she therefore contented herself with saying that m noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer	69.2081

now when evening came dants put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it	59.4453
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	29.9289
if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more  fernands eye darted lightning	42.0095
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling  what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian  nonsense	69.0607
no i do not jest mordieu i should like to have seen you in my place	13.8777
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner  have you a spanish prisoner cried the prince	26.0755

because tomorrow hayde you will be free you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours	34.4347
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the kings attorney	18.7845
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking	20.4155
the queen was standing in the room pale with anger her self control however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm	21.4626
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride	10.6275
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	26.0859
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath	70.1007
once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything	134.5691
every instant mme	94.8829
good day commander  ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	16.9325

i am sure of itthey would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step	34.3471
have you killed the cardinal	17.7825
this room was occupied by dants father	69.9021
dartagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais  what then  the bodies were not plundered were they	37.7321
my lord said dartagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible  that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation	27.6643
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word	31.5150
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door	32.3413
five millions on five little scraps of paperit must be seen to be believed  you do not doubt it  no  you say so with an accentstay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum  no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself	170.6353
there are the horses	24.7268
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	31.0198
friends are shadows	136.8701
well then you must be registered as charlotte backson  milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror	20.5877
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating	45.0033
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too	22.4748
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of 500 francs per annum paid quarterly	106.4285
i thought i had quite said groslow	47.4717
this adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lock up cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured	174.0277
dartagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down	78.2884
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz	22.1799
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the rospoli palace	27.1112
what is your opinion gentlemen and does not m moustons suggestion appear to you full of sense  oh said aramis suppose the master is a puritan  so much the better mordioux replied dartagnan if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens  but if he should be a cavalier said porthos	54.0589
40227m    the stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair  edmond you will not kill my son  the count retreated a step uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the pistol he held	78.2733
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since	38.9778
it was a quarter past midday	15.1844
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at half past two oclock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall	29.4520
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one	41.4672
but after his bath asked morcerf	20.6865
when i am convinced that the statement is false  what  the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly  but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamps last remark	79.4951
you do not avoid going to war by that means you see the cardinal is about to make the next campaign helm on head and partisan in hand	55.9553
what were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that monsieur de beaufort had escaped were you not  oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier	30.8837
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with agony	55.3944
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him  then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared	20.3477
parliament can never have passed such an act as that  at this moment the landlord came in	28.1900
yes yes continued m de trville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court	22.6823
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation  you see cried dartagnan	15.3996
holloa	97.9861
dants your health  fernand rose impatiently	91.7076
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race	71.8223
spur spur and he fired two pistols	25.1319
it is over aramis had said	79.4845
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	55.8277
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol	56.4906
the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and i have heard nothing of either of them since	27.5174
but monsieur commissary said he calmly believe that i know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed  indeed asked the commissary with an air of doubt	91.6345
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i cannot throw you out of window for three weeksthat is to say for twenty four days to comenor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed	38.0271
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults	234.9290
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	13.8853
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects  grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	48.9536
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	20.8386
chapter 114 peppino  at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente	18.0563
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	38.2035
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercds with his eyes glowing and his hands clenchedsay mercds he said once for all is this your final determination  i love edmond dants the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband  and you will always love him  as long as i live  fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils saidbut if he is dead  if he is dead i shall die too  if he has forgotten you  mercds called a joyous voice from withoutmercds  ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am  fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him	371.7964
edmond found some solace in these ideas	20.5302
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday	21.7389
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole  monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	52.4377
i have it still  50235m    the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the htel despagne	13.5615
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met	12.5434
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two  is monsieur aramis with dartagnan asked lord de winter	92.3396
look  at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	25.8386
you see that i cannot like you for instance settle on any fixed plan  thou liest subtile one said dartagnan to himself	26.8570
you wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written it  well said morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violencewell and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent mewho will dare prevent me	55.1002
for my part i should not hesitate a moment i should take the hundred pistoles	25.2990
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fte should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it	48.8496
the three friends burst into laughter	15.3775
count he said you are not the same here as in paris  how so  here you laugh the counts brow became clouded	67.6961
a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	12.3687
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune	95.7628
bonacieux somebody is coming  immediately the door opened and the superior entered	27.0467
i draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in paris at the end of this month	46.5932
it is you who sent by him to constantinople to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon	46.5491
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved	15.8762
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something	131.6061
but thats more than dislike thats ingratitude	87.2412
halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers	16.2508
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me  courage madame	31.3082
have i by any means displeased you	46.7254
my uncle answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my family  cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well  mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant  when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed	142.8612
i have what is still better	94.8635
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies	26.9767
who are these gentleman  three of the kings musketeers	37.9386
m danglars no longer had a daughter	38.8043
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him  the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire	34.0967
who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension	25.2198
absurd	12.3458
the cardinals guards cried aramis and porthos at the same time	17.1698
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugnie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage  hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone hayde may hear you perhaps  and you think she would be angry  no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression	77.9148
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	21.9560
the citizen followed him	57.5973
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	30.4597
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest	34.0860
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat	36.3735
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which dartagnan had hitherto resided	66.2358
the young girl smiled	20.8411
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open	33.9884
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman	29.7330
everything fell out as mme	223.6055
he is at constantinople  among the turks exclaimed raoul alarmed	30.4612
there he is  somebody has disturbed him without doubt said dartagnan	45.7115
dartagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last dartagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe	33.2272
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	47.6562
i had no such contempt for men before  was i not a good ambassador in france  yes for mazarin has granted what i desire  have i not always fought for your glory and interests  too ardently perhaps it is what i have just reproached you for	170.4164
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs	33.6704
i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristoand certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses	169.5203
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams	38.5681
that same night the general was to go over to the english	52.9164
the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant	99.9911
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service  had treated with the seraskier15 kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that ali tepeliniafter having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidenceresolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge  and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora  monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert	66.2301
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith	65.5471
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master	48.7355
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter	36.1022
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant  true said m davrigny we will return  the doctor went out first followed by m de villefort	36.1046
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows  they ascended five or six more steps and then dants felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro	71.7036
ah pardieu said he rising you come in the nick of time gentlemen	28.6170
does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked monte cristo	18.6169

when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan  then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys  the major drew himself up to his full height	91.7153

the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any	31.5991
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de chteau renaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint mran despised all who were not noble	107.7554
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform	13.5266
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait  yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners  bah said athos	159.3002
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of san felice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded	56.7052

why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it	18.6518
is he handsome she asked	59.6065
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris	104.6906
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had leftmy saving knife but i could not reach the bolster	19.7859

four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers	100.7557
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french	32.4383
let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors  your bills at least are the first that will fall due  do you wish for time to pay  a delay would save my honor and consequently my life  how long a delay do you wish for  morrel reflected	38.2719
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father  i hope you do not doubt it  30137m    go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you  andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	43.1341
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body	28.1294
the number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days	22.4310
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him  faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here  tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him  the servant bowed and retired	97.6971

then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal	11.5646
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out	35.7950
cromwell had sent him to mazarin	24.2240
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	23.2072
the commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the table	32.5880
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him	13.1656
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france  one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague ont	48.1781

now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away  ah sighed caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married  the truth is replied dants that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow  danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression	270.4163

when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist	21.2679
i shall be happy to meet you again sir  may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish murmured dartagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard	56.7378
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before	25.7837
m de villefort was therefore obliged to request m davrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances	28.7576
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained	55.6690
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	49.4697
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say	58.1841
his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell	26.0617

bonacieux retired	389.4055
to grief succeeded rage	663.4125
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means  and i have none either said the queen	51.0319
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake	55.0406

my darling	412.2293

as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	76.1199
there however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank	33.9593
his name tell it me  then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistancefor i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than deaththe executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame	81.8850
fernand dashed his on the ground	20.8593
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem	94.4394
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this  since 1811  dants shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison	22.0086
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket  never mind we shall see	24.0696
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results	30.5425
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury  a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes	78.4178
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him	27.0912
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactorthen count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols	125.9552

yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember  yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate  in four days said morrel it is extraordinary  indeed said chteau renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too	71.5146
if he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him i would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other i would have run my sword through his body  i expected as much said athos and that was why i threw myself between you and him	33.0030

he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	24.1676
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you  be it so then replied athos sorrowfully	45.0208
certainly all four we couldnt leave our prisoners could we  ah	115.3353

the old servant came	43.4584
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon  but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons  stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen and he raised his cane six inches higher	210.6282
no	19.2502
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner	33.2529
dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work	27.4225
at what hour inquired a turnkey	137.0173

a black satin stock fresh from the makers hands gray moustaches a bold eye a majors uniform ornamented with three medals and five crossesin fact the thorough bearing of an old soldiersuch was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted	76.6616
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness     since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have     the good fortune to be beloved by you	49.0659
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one	25.6873
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window	25.8651
he seated himself at his desk and dartagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter	38.7227
i will sit facing stuart whom i like so much to see especially where he now is and you monsieur dartagnan opposite to me  athos turned red with rage	137.4043
how sometimes the unhappy mistake chance for providence	142.2704

a man of from thirty five to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style	41.5372
the orders came	626.0208
in spite of his usual command over himself dants could not restrain his impetuosity	21.8146
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol	14.4317
often before his captivity dants mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers	25.3713
you may retire said milady	42.1012
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money	44.0467
ah thats it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony  we are going to fetch our brevets said dartagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them  and where are we going asked porthos	36.9138
when all had gone out and the door was closed m de trville on turning round found himself alone with the young man	28.7697
having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat  exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right  but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said chteau renaud	80.1337
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste	25.6945
then remarking the strange expression of miladys countenance she said pardon me madame you know him by what title  why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of friend  you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress  it is you who have been his mistress madame cried milady in her turn	184.6823
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	65.2081
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercds dress brush past him and his sons warm breath pronouncing these words  courage mother	67.6580

the clock striking eight awoke her	34.7001
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule	42.7175
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed	23.0483
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell  and are you going to leave me at such a time  this very instant  and where are you going  ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service  ah me	86.9604
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him	26.5324
that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want  we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself	54.4910
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo  is all safe and sound m morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the voyage  then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker  the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war	87.7760
gentlemen said he if monsieur dartagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur dartagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal  you have my word monsieur and here is my sword  this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey  if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find her  what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly	56.4929

dartagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	10.9921
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her  monte cristo started	22.3857

in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage	28.6675
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man	61.1763
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth  well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures	186.0588
that happened which m de trville had foreseen	28.8887
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moments repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england	45.2236
his bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again	66.8432
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of	38.9586
no	93.8979

but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying  you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church  at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis	130.0295
i remember too well	112.3293
however to teresas great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening	24.9454
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me  fortune has been kind to you then	62.0848
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled	40.8560
the door had been opened and shut again the mercers pretty wife had disappeared	24.5584
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole htel was boiling	14.2384
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples	17.6136

who are you asked the man	15.3565
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams	32.1844
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind	23.3374
that great giant who was there gave it to him  in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick  so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins  and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him  to be sure the coadjutor has promised  who told you that  monsieur maillard himself  you have seen him then  certainly i was there when he fell  what were you doing there  i was shouting down with mazarin death to the cardinal the italian to the gallows isnt that what you would have me shout  be quiet you rascal said bazin looking uneasily around	96.1556
dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martins babylonian pictures	61.4097
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless	21.2070
she is ill	58.0587
dartagnan is for mazarin he said to himself	45.9799
no object affects me and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you	26.9914
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation	17.6691

i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos  day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the other	151.1497
it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres  yes  to whom do you desire to leave this fortune  oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	46.7258
i know it is a weakness said caderousse but it overpowers me  and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick  come said caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me	62.2130
now gentlemen said dartagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire  the englishmen bowed and went upstairs	29.1562
luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind	6.8666

at chlons i was put upon the sane thence i passed on to the rhne whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles	130.7160
at the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads	9.9082
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo	14.4464
now sir said dartagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier	31.7906

julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the alles de meilhan	60.5896
so you hate each other said the count	26.3009
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred	27.2445
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven	20.8657

ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey	16.3596
her very self she gave it me last night	98.7561
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	14.6750
then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin  this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it	32.1499
precisely so replied gaetano	59.9310

m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night	15.0383
the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard	18.5741

bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed	34.9622
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	19.7474
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers	89.4034

when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now	96.7352
call the viscount and take the musket with you  blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province	78.4057
come come said andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up and he held out his hands to be manacled	23.9560
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	50.2418
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor	34.1767
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse	20.3724
m danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his ill humor	41.9807
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england	36.0553
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything	12.7561

chapter xv	82.0978
the matter was arranged as dartagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions	82.9676
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo	12.0308
finally said felton finally what did they do  at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer	29.5718
save me	1.4061
why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere  it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franzs host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges	81.2704

my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question  what is it sir  you are fond of gardening  passionately  and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres  sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it  you live badly on your thousand francs  badly enough but yet i do live  yes but you have a wretchedly small garden  true the garden is not large  and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything  ah they are my scourges  tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphing  i should not see him  then what would happen  i could not repeat the signals  and then  not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined  how much  a hundred francs  the tenth of your incomethat would be fine work  ah said the man	26.5142
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	8.9200
the next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at st valery	9.2470
there is one thing only which i must request  what is it	53.5220
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franzs former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened	97.0189
there to his great astonishment dartagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into	173.0711
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	41.9441

this feeling lasted but for a moment	26.5079
i am lost said dartagnan to himself	9.6309
mon dieu	1.0005
of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a woman	35.6293
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for dartagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors	81.6943
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly	28.0945
meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here	79.0406
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	19.4605
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes	25.7036
dartagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the chateau du vallon	20.0813
adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping edmonds hand convulsivelyadieu  oh nono not yet he cried do not forsake me	12.1523
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected	26.8893
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince	20.4933
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it	79.0693
and for whomfor some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison	13.9444
so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abb who really was gentleness itself  yes you will much oblige me  go into my study here and i will show it to you  and they both entered m de bovilles study	61.6526
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel	32.5030
let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other	18.5761
danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin	7.3110
at the sight of dartagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken	11.9293
edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale	26.1543
three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him	18.0837
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die  monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness	49.0497
he is at bergen in norway  heaven preserve him said the queen	10.2839
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment	40.4558
and now prisoner will you consent to tell your name said the president	48.1559
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	67.4389
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view	15.8305
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father  then sire may i present him  this instant duke	57.6250
but the voyage was not ended	34.1050
villefort continued  he knows me and i have pledged my word to him	36.1993
no my lord be assured we shall not  dartagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation	31.3547
you are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your worth	29.3808
we hope so answered the curates	58.9036
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted	26.8093
and now monsieur dartagnan he said prepare to set off for saint germain and take a letter from me to the queen     chapter lxxxviii	27.8338
i say i am entirely of porthoss opinion replied aramis	22.0614
more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost money  m	36.9694
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand	50.9231
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight  absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre  at one oclock this morning she had not returned  my god	48.4462
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady	44.5175
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box  enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty  here it is replied aramis	105.6617
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon let me do what i please and do you what i do  they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses	44.9279
do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port  it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back	87.4727
yes monsieur officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your service  come in said the officer	28.1590
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	32.4113
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie	19.1221
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever	177.4328
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate	43.1086
the steward wished to turn to the left	36.9174
yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite  planchet was sent for and instructions were given him	122.3683
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman	30.7642
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter	44.2363
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow	44.1308
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden	10.7694
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away	77.3232
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others	37.8479
approach gentlemen said albert i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you  proceed sir said the count	23.8018
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	17.0625
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late  you see said athos pointing to mme	18.9072
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection  that is possible said the countess reflecting	25.0441
the second was the mans conventional abode or rather sleeping place it contained a few poor articles of household furniturea bed a table two chairs a stone pitcherand some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes	265.7278
coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey	12.1046
chapter lxii	89.2736
this affair made a great noise	40.4666
if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you himself	35.8028
and in whose behalf are you looking for them  you are in no doubt on that score  that is true  unfortunately i have no idea where they are  and you have no way to get news of them	32.3246
let us go to breakfast  i shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry  yes said porthos my air is excellent  they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt	34.7262
oh continue said the duchess	28.4023
mazarin did not even turn around	20.1331
raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud	63.6361
you believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god	29.9885
i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days	81.9446
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a magdalen by correggiowas raised and turned towards him	36.3517
this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding place and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flower garden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance	476.4332
no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m de villefort  no the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator	34.4943
accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes	44.2371
i alsoi love you	44.2444
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel  son	28.7841
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother i demand justice upon you and i swear that if it be not granted to me i will execute it myself  and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of dartagnan leaving the place free for another accuser	251.1303
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	35.9240
well	48.5279
it was aramis	40.4985
dants from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	15.8594
so that now it is no longer hatred but vengeance  indeed  and the queen believes  well what does the queen believe  she believes that someone has written to the duke of buckingham in her name  in the queens name  yes to make him come to paris and when once come to paris to draw him into some snare  the devil	79.4917
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is magnificent	40.9361
edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize himself	29.2242
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant societythose manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions	96.5894
the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the duc de chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of madame de longueville on the place royale	51.6966
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her	34.1292
valery but listen	36.0193
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime	48.5415
i have a sure method of limbering tongues	8.0872
hey	43.5802
come gentlemen let us all propose some place	44.9978
good heavens	14.4571
now said dartagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it  i hope the accident has been of no consequence  they dont yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured  at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper	80.1449
tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room	54.9852
now then said andrea while dressing himself ill wait till he leaves and then ill slip away  50047m    and saying this andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain	140.4065
i breathe more freely in fact porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs	60.8472
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best  ah m morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owners hand m	29.2063
but if i mistake not continued he here he is you wont forget the boy sir  raoul put his hand in his pocket	44.8220
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger	73.3792
even his breathing seemed to be arrested	30.2940
you are irritated and vexedtell me how this fernand is related to you  he is merely my father said albertm	22.6585
do you know that monsieur  the king commands it madame excuse me  i will not suffer it	18.6120
but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet	25.3335
silence  but you promised me whispered the poor mercer	41.0795
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage	14.9932
these were all who were left of the little troop	32.2745
mercds drew near and plucked the fruit	17.3709
dartagnan looked much disconcerted	38.1497
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you  thats well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him trville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him	32.3629
does your honor want a horse asked mousqueton	54.3232
what is the use of boring ones self with so many things	7.0990
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise  but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained	101.0558
i know how clear sighted your dreams are i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to you	111.9682
9 money and sanctity each in a moiety  10 elisabeth de rossan marquise de ganges was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv	13.8502
read it  obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him	73.7474
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse	21.0560
so now i have told my secret  a telegraph repeated madame de villefort	26.6214
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv	21.8888
chapter li	59.0645
what is to be done asked dartagnan	11.4145
no but gaetano did i thought  gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone  and if this person be not a smuggler who is he  a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure  come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree  what is his name  if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name  sinbad the sailor  yes  and where does he reside  on the sea  what country does he come from  i do not know  have you ever seen him  sometimes  what sort of a man is he  your excellency will judge for yourself  where will he receive me  no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of  have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace  oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word  decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure  his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel	141.6560
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	22.2354
i do not knowi only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells  yes sir a rope ladder and tools  and have you them yet  no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left  what is it asked the count impatiently	251.7103
well i went to a horse dealers where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named mdah	22.7980
with all my heart	19.7163
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants	47.4313
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent	14.7478
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasinesscorsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	108.4737
spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend	28.2216
and i idem said aramis	22.8806
are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society	31.7285
he was thinking of mme	36.1340
chapter 26 the pont du gard inn  such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegardea little nearer to the former than to the lattera small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard	170.3888
it is waiting for us at greenwich opposite the isle of dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights	31.6574
sir said davrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentines maid if you please  villefort went himself to find her and davrigny approached noirtier	49.1443
thank you said edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven	41.9686
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself  i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti	58.6565
sir sir cried he turning to noirtier do what you canmake me understand in some way  yes replied noirtier	35.5257
three hundred pistoles  oh plenty	29.4940
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dants entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative	28.2632
the man was caderoussehe was pale and his shirt was all bloody	19.8903
but you come from england	40.5902
escape had never once occurred to him	19.8625
but where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	19.5593
dartagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale	34.8837
bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees	28.6000
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand	10.1744
alone valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit	59.0353
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	43.9764
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the htel	13.1844
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception	47.0956
have the goodness to send mine to athoss residence	24.8631
imitate me	4.4682
now said he that sufficesbegone  which way  the way you came  you wish me to get out at that window  you got in very well  oh you have some design against me reverend sir  idiot	81.1253
interrogate me i entreat you  where is your wife in the first place  why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me  yes but yesterday at five oclock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped  my wife escaped cried bonacieux	31.9788
and what is your choice asked jussac	17.2491
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives  the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him  pardon me said he but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw  come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it  by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it  be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal	50.1352
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarinimpossible	18.4346
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	12.3006
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea besides we are conversing in italian  well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs down  monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales  i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them  you have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold	99.4385
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune	24.3532
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of lopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it	207.2966
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing	40.2829
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity	34.8844
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength	30.3415
and what do you know about them monsieur	36.5978
bonacieux recovered her senses	61.5535
you will tell me that i am a living being and not a codea man and not a volume	22.6133
dartagnan dartagnan cried mme	328.9327
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat	13.0472
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do	74.8514
behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you	73.0651
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued	511.7403
then mine is the boat you want sir	80.6140
tell me what i am to do for this  a very easy thing if your horse isnt tired  i tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to drive  towards the louvres  ah i know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over there  exactly so i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval	71.5396

has the law any eyes to witness your grief	99.9472
and why did you refuse my son inquired the old man	13.7934
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter	11.2046
these protestations were nothing for mme	65.1756
chapter lxxxv	192.3155
i bear the traces of our friendshipthree slits or slashes from your sword  well if you should be restored to favor dont forget me  on the honor of a rochefort but you must do the like for me  theres my handi promise  therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf  i shall say it and you  i shall do the same  apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis	71.6189
signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal  when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man  sir said dpinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signaturessince you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfactiontell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father  villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfathers answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps	784.9418
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs  oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman	21.7669
valentine	72.4983
oh it was cruel to us anddare i say itto you also  listen my friends said the counti may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know	141.9715
who talks of dying	36.9813
but dartagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos	37.5205
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	98.9114
csar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncles papers there is a will  they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless	391.4181
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse	68.0102
can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which i have just received said the astonished athos	30.3329
no divided as we now are we must perish	81.6140
thats true said he quietly for my part i have never loved  acknowledge then you stony heart said dartagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts  tender hearts	17.4324
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady	11.9507
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage	11.1142
this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him  let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said davrigny	38.9882
you know the vessel is lost  the pharaon sirthey signal the pharaon	26.1991
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	59.4277
but we are no longer in the city sir said she	20.4094
yes replied porthos coughing	20.3230
but if he annoys you this young fool  to be sure he does	27.7203
there is the true reason	29.0005
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries	14.2840
oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what  i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me  and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him  the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving	398.3329
mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity  are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled  by whom  by the joices the prinns the cromwells  by a tailor a coachmaker a brewer	48.6834
and the next day bernajoux	18.0869
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly	35.1606
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty  the king smiling turned a few steps back	26.1287
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	24.8689
it is for me to reply to that and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn	18.5221
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	37.5884
i was taken to versailles for three months i struggled with death at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south	30.6581
whether queens or not they are always the same  do you disapprove of this journey my dear m dartagnan asked mazarin anxiously	38.3650
chapter xxxvi	59.6719
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	20.0119
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to bertuccio said  excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner  and so closes our interview said andrea to the worthy steward i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil  i will return tomorrow said bertuccio	122.5905
i have told you that i am prepared for anything  the two travelers knocked at the door	11.8982
this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the alles de meilhan	130.2631
it was mercds leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	27.0637
you go to madame daguillons and you pay your court to her you go to madame de bois tracys the cousin of madame de chevreuse and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady	41.1488
 we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name	31.1600
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray	26.1425
the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands	18.5867
i will await you at the corner of the rue du muse and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me  then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation  yes	44.7463
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not  you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief  while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy	65.7827
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tablethe rarest of all luxuries in their complete formare well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers	98.8558
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth  do you propose to me to do so dartagnan  decidedly and honestly  on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon	73.2487
i am anxious to know the state of your health  he calls that a language	36.8329
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of hayde as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	104.0533
i comprehend now  you comprehend said porthos	109.0224
it was only a precaution	29.7900
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitors cross the carriage was taking the direct road to it	35.2867
i told you of it yesterday	37.5677
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse  the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection	69.6336
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of aramis  monsieur dartagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale	47.5819
hey said the cardinal opening the door	16.5192
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing	33.6990
i am a great captainthat i am	6.5204
the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair	19.0639
you are not hurt asked dartagnan	19.8129
danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage	13.8956
unfortunately edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular	19.2289
i cannot stop a moment i must start for paris again immediately  what	58.4227
bonacieux	58.6887
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man whoa rather improbable thinghad stolen his fathers letter from himwas there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred	22.3521
i love to see you thus	74.9194
with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint mran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at m de villeforts in connection with his attachment for valentine	81.0643
now i recollect  what  to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pre pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my wedding	24.5623
when i say one spoonful i began by onenow i take four	36.1863
the host was in a lower and back room to which athos was requested to go	49.2620
captivity the fifth day   milady had however achieved a half triumph and success doubled her forces	24.0685
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut trees	29.6164
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel	47.3045
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn	40.1188
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	39.6855
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers  very well monsieur i will obey you at all points  athos made two visits in paris at seven oclock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	114.6243
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people	19.9249
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe	48.0673
so au revoir dear athos  au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought	13.9932
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercds she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her	43.6713
if they meant to execute him at la grve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution	32.9970
i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by	31.2301
oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees	39.5981
i shall hear this morning that m danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifes this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france	57.2332
they rose about eight oclock in the winter about six in summer and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m de trvilles	51.1133
maximilian morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests	25.2657
lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her	33.2621
charming said mazarin	25.0374
follow him said athos	8.8100
he had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome everywhere	18.6786
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow  then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today  i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read  this treasure which may amount to two  of roman crowns in the most distant a  of the second opening wh  declare to belong to him alo  heir	39.5052
take care my young friend	23.7747
athos was right	50.0408
but he does wrong to use his privilege	54.6150
chapter xxxix	117.8324
pardon me monsieur but you are not  my lord the duke of buckingham said mme	18.4694
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good  ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered  my poor girl you know him already  i know him  yes it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son  the count of monte cristo  the same  ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine  the friend of madame de villefort	137.5804
they rode on in this way for ten minutes	30.7186
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner  how foolish you are	19.6666
go  oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness	34.9904
what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evincednone whatever	46.5900
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	26.1418
have you not yet divined who he is  what cried felton heagain healways he	14.1642
ah monsieur said the young man i meet you then at last	19.6019
my letter of recommendation cried dartagnan my letter of recommendation	71.9245
two hours passed thus	8.5767
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheard of piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that henri iv	71.7665
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly  i shall go he said to the queen  well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris  to whom  zounds	88.7403
groslow whom dartagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile	16.5548
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required  i know it said athos coolly since here it is  and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels	63.6319
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company  it was about four oclock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them	92.2910
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold	26.3104
but i must not forget one grand point  which  that i have been singularly assisted  nonsense  i have indeed  by circumstances  no by you  by me	45.3312
now we may say at last thank heaven	51.2045
the affair at armentieres asked he again	36.4510
can you enlighten me on that point  i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse	34.6101
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying  you promise sirthats agreedthat i shall find you to morrow at charenton  oh dont be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre	83.5263
himself	61.3432
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from dartagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment	62.6982
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	49.5251
you come from the queen said mazarin looking fixedly at dartagnan	20.5050
we shall see returned the other smiling	29.8675
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off	53.5727
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six oclock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening	84.4007
the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage	41.3438
how do you think these garments fit me  wonderfully said dartagnan but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better  what asked porthos	31.5395
do you understand asked villefort	15.3053
my husband has five or six valises you shall choose the best	16.4791
i see you to tell you that everything separates usthe depths of the sea the enmity of kingdoms the sanctity of vows	14.1891
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston  i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued	55.1093
you have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than m de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany  on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently	149.5694
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument	16.6961
you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta	14.4906
and now farewell  farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror	6.6998
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged	63.6034
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them  reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe  buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	54.6752
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women	29.3522
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	27.5734
on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends  they re entered the drawing room which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted	23.7327
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	20.9394
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated	35.5778
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmers son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback	272.6778
well i shall look upon it as an expiation  ah said dartagnan i know what you mean  and i too added aramis but you must not think of that athos what is past is past  i dont understand said porthos	31.1793
nothing but intrigues	61.1888
perhaps you would prefer being alone  no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls	61.8614
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenbergs goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg collection will remain freely available for generations to come	18.6730
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door	46.8913
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel	72.9746
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts	34.9581
yes albert from whatever source the blow may have proceededit may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence  albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamps arm  my friend said he my life is ended	175.2882
dants employed it in manuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities	144.9362
where the devil shall i say that he is so that he cannot try to rejoin him thought dartagnan	25.3716
it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance	22.9271
i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that	19.7019
i have eight men on guard you know	47.1562
yes my prince  my prince interrupted dartagnan	36.3624
oh	25.7326
i won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then i lost again	52.7519
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when dartagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered herthese were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure	133.9651
carlini besought his chief to make an exception in ritas favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom	33.9190
the countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart	57.4696
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	10.7601
well over that coach house are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments  ah diable bells did you say  what do you mean  oh nothing	49.7140
you have read the letter  yes  you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class	13.1584
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession	56.9780
dants followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve	68.3530
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascons uneasiness	36.0101
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	64.6130
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain  have they not heard that of their colonel	31.0741
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos	69.2884
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious	29.8455
i will tell you mr president	14.6324
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	30.3199
perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison  briefly what did you learn  that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals	99.8514
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i love him and will be only his were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself  the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts	129.0373
ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself  alas yes murmured de winter	34.5988
oh god prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead  oh god murmured the girl leave me my mother  your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning around	981.5814
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life	52.2417
he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercds nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband	76.2339
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dants began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain	60.5083
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step	23.2044
yes a passage of st augustine upon which we could not agree said the gascon	30.6390
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make	144.6631
your excellency he said the master of the htel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf  a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz	25.0844
eleven oclock sounded	2.0351
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal	67.2744
the pates were excellent the wine delicious	69.0313
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist	27.1044
in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits	13.1780
have you gone mad my dear friend  what is the matter returned dartagnan we are saved  i dont see that at all answered porthos	23.1582
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs	173.6882
he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself	30.6533
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last  and milady stretched out her arms to mme	33.9672
i never visit ministers i leave that to the princes  really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us up  i will not speak again said chteau renaud pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say  come let us endeavor to get to the end of our story beauchamp i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her  well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at m de villeforts is that there is an assassin in the house  the two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them	391.5103
yes the porter  my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house  well  the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise  by whom  by thieves  you are a fool m baptistin	62.9194
it is very simple mousqueton had said he is thinking of groslow  it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parrys head	43.5205
their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets	17.0672
i am a ruined man lost destroyed  bah said athos we were always dry  if you had been contented with drinking well and good but you have broken all the bottles  you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down	71.6069
fatality  chapter l chat between brother and sister  chapter li	9.8707
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that  very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count	56.2557
he married a woman who keeps a confectioners shop in the rue des lombards for hes a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats hes now a citizen of paris	24.4100
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool enough  porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe	26.5907
monsieur the governor was all astonishment	58.1455
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy	14.6060
do you wish for a name	17.4167
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister  my father said the young man bending his knee bless me morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said  oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you	47.4281
morbleu i wont be their dupe i will answer for it	16.2104
am i or am i not the queen	69.7515
who will support them  a shudder ran through the young mans frame	19.3900
during the daytime valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child	139.8696
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid  the queen smiled	30.2231
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way	23.7233
porthos was the first to speak	16.3000
sire said dartagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question  louis xiv	16.3999
what was all that to scarron	75.1362
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair	74.0390
the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe	28.1942
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them	31.0452
he drew back terrified	113.1833
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him	17.4785
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you  so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by dartagnans inventive imagination	108.3549
it was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him	11.7209
the letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written words	10.6540
i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days  nor i said madame danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish  which  m	39.1989
rest assured we shall not see her  and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal  immediately	19.9889
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair players	23.5550
in brief i regained your harness and then mine	58.6966
50181m    the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort	18.0321
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard	35.3999
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods justice  he will be found  well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required  your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fte given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	129.1420
from athos cried dartagnan recognizing the handwriting	27.6804
her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven	24.4184
he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom	95.4702
we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital	249.7832
indeed you could not belong to him	16.1738
come he said if i pay you the 100000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease  certainly said peppino	28.2633
porthos kill every one who stands in your way  and after pressing the hand of athos dartagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist	81.3258
he was charming	59.9312
you know well that i dont like to leave things half finished  conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis	30.6860
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room	14.5718
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle  then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation  see raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting  the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed	70.5383

this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	57.0599
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	33.5426
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on limpartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor	43.8535
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say  why yes replied dartagnan with embarrassment	21.1436
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me  you wrong me my boy now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone knowing as i do the goodness of your heart	203.2685
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurators wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse	54.7598
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days  to get married  yes first and then to go to paris  very good have what time you require dants	46.0248
keep quiet while my master is being arrested	35.7082
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out	21.5364
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos	40.9534
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	46.9354
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of laiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas	112.1413
so much the better	2.6861
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles	31.3552
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going	90.0517
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	23.1539
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks	42.7676
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table  what are the two fish asked danglars	29.9841
must see him	30.0019
from whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife  from monsieur laporte  did he give you any details  he knew none himself  and you have learned nothing from any other quarter  yes i have received  what  i fear i am committing a great imprudence  you always come back to that but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat  i do not retreat mordieu cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage	95.1557
the evening was no longer joy but delirium	58.9809
through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street	28.9650
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house	97.7928
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way  no nonsense caderousse  i will offer myself as floor polisher  the rooms are all carpeted  well then i must be contented to imagine it  that is the best plan believe me  try at least to give me an idea of what it is  how can i  nothing is easier	201.3551
joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent	98.6520
hardly had dartagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication	37.2970
in ten minutes mazarin and his party were traversing the street les bons enfants behind the theatre built by richelieu expressly for the play of mirame and in which mazarin who was an amateur of music but not of literature had introduced into france the first opera that was ever acted in that country	99.5987
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him	14.5150
the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires	33.4931
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money	131.5186
kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women	28.5706
and according to his custom dartagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him	37.0668
the two musketeers met at the gate	26.6388
excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously	13.1606
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction	97.5883
did he send you  yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you i have come in fifteen hours  albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper	89.2997
appeared walking fast	146.5443
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you  30157m    i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service	26.5882
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled	36.2430
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten him	11.5630
here it is  the hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the yard	25.1218
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	13.1883
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself	35.7741
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee	12.5587
mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly  danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied	28.3571
the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed  then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned  and why not said monte cristo coldly	1269.5396
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish	68.5862
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues	65.9108
to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well	62.5047
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate	14.5813
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this worlds affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east	19.1888
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	30.5680
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door	8.0522
villequier said guitant	65.9976
is that all  yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	38.5355
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter	25.0631
ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	19.6084
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and dartagnan was a gentleman	31.5967
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands  oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy	67.9688
my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer  upon the gospel said dartagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did  i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures	76.4462
you particularly wish it asked he	101.9681
the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans bless with holy water sprinklers which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers	8.4749
look out cried dartagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder	22.5596
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at  stay said debray i recognize this hobbema  ah indeed  yes it was proposed for the museum  which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo	58.7024
i detest her from antipathy  or rather by instinct  perhaps so	34.6248
monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk muchmonsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar  but where is athos now cried dartagnan	52.4552
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her	85.6955
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table	46.7418
come  the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristos door	45.8584
above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird	47.9616
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen  private interests are as nothing before the interests of all	50.8940
it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling	34.5573
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion rocheforts lackey would precede it as courier	12.1617
ah	87.9403
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior	15.5414
he was convinced that luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chausse dantin	29.4641
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	100.4647
people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim  father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of january	274.9093
we need not add that the goldsmith oreilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any pretext	17.3672
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time	47.7356
i will do my best  well then let us goi must trust to you  it is very fortunate said dartagnan to himself	11.7261
so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday	27.3947
he told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber	131.3633
welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friends ransom that this had happened  but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscounti do not see him  nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly	155.4372
the guard obeyed	275.4934
you love me you cried he	44.6005
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free  the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as alberts prison and franz and the count followed him	47.6259
have you proof of this  i had it  and you have lost it how stupid  yes but by careful search it might be recovered  really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me  and the count humming an air from lucia went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts	157.4237
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address	36.4540
had a real liking for trvillea royal liking a self interested liking it is true but still a liking	15.8863
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte	22.3960
and nothing more	135.3683
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires  monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurators wife and not to say a word of the wound  thats agreed you have my word  oh he would kill me  dont be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he appears  saying these words dartagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interestedhis debt and his life	168.8216
you speak first  oh no	90.8313
my place of abode is no	66.5827
chapter 32 the waking  when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	26.9403
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner	15.5899
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the alles de meilhan at marseilles	47.3554
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong	12.9289
then dartagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend	23.9793
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop	102.2964
the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two	37.8001
will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here  no i do not replied monte cristo it is a small place i have purchased quite lately	36.3133
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos	34.5655
the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale	45.2204
in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual	38.7293
seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrowthe wound is too deep and too fresh	30.6014
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter	18.3720
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills	15.2541
yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman	24.6831
on whom does my bleeding heart repose	25.9049
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called olivain the lackey who had followed him from blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign	51.9762
her will be done like that of god in all things  then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part	43.2527
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you	29.9757
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	30.8856
chapter iv	177.5392
i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when you see one prisoner you see allalways the same thingill fed and innocent	30.5038
do you not think with me m de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush  it is probable sire replied villefort	26.5577
chapter xxx	76.0728
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is	24.0454
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival	27.1609
now m bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service  why  because i should never get a better  probabilities are deceptive  but i deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death  do you possess that right over bertuccio  yes  there are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts yes  the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirty two horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours	270.2314
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself  yes	47.3003
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis	10.9412
i am the queen do you recognize me  no madame replied dartagnan	27.5417
i mean as i love	122.7972
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand	51.3759
read for yourself and judge  porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words  the queen wishes to speak to monsieur dartagnan who must follow the bearer  well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary  but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied dartagnan	70.2525
yes said they we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england	51.5112
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos	27.0874
i have no right to it	28.0899
now m le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin  the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny	172.4667
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace	13.8382
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you  madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage	100.0682
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life	35.3049
i didnt understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is  you think so	50.6806
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine oclock in the morning to take a third letter	19.3767
for france were i to specify my wishes i should have too much	39.1736
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more  who i am madame	110.7973
this i ask of you in the name of the interest with which i inspire you in the name of the service you have rendered me and which i never shall forget while i have life	23.6686
i have replied morrel	69.5225
dartagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon dartagnans sword	37.5785
teach bazin prosody that will console him	5.1930
oh my god	6.6139
he is saved cried dants in a paroxysm of delight	29.2758
five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered	19.6136
but remorse is not thus banished like virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair	52.0632
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dants	43.2552
ill circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow	19.5039
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance	57.6311
i found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend	21.8414
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but dartagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kittys apartment	67.8835
albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the counts kindness	30.9926
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos	11.6118
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of monte cristo	123.2911
but is he really a prince  i will not answer for it said monte cristo	20.2225
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect	47.7103
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all  the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton  that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy i should be a ruined man  no for porthos will pay you  hum said the host in a doubtful tone	84.9946
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos  all gascon as he was dartagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	78.9684
i have the purse still by mea large one made of red silk  and asked the abb is m morrel still alive  yes replied caderousse	77.8242
have i friends	1138.4828
barrois made some steps towards his master	67.2066
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others	38.0949
he had passed the night standing and without sleep	52.0542
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of arstein  eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon m lafitte	47.8580
i will arm him against love  alas madame exclaimed athos to day love is like warthe breastplate is becoming useless  raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day	335.1431
the queen had them	214.4017
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered	27.9096
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you  in a very simple manner colonel said dartagnan	69.2316
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself  the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor	45.6445
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	44.9132
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m de villefort  indeed said m danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care  as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence  what you count said madame danglars signing if you are take care for i shall never forgive you  andrea pricked up his ears	132.0890
it seems to me i did my duty	15.6628
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over  and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer	97.0776
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which dartagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude  the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail	56.1656
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her  good murmured milady the austere puritan lies  as to the soldier he only smiled	35.2743
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me  40168m    no for i saw gods justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence  gods justice	36.4462
it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial	11.2345
nevertheless monsieur de trvilles company of musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will	50.6524
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face	22.4620
yes my lord answered the man	14.2729
a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality	61.7899
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful  how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable	30.5728
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	29.8962
the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him	20.3334
well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied	59.0406
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity	16.2285
you are questioning me like a kings attorney	25.4020
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold	19.8161
accordingly dartagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him	31.7916
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself	43.7174
dartagnan	84.1596
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last  i dont know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord	28.2362
will you  this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain	91.9519
decidedly monsieur dartagnan you are the man i have been seeking	22.6658
0311m    edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as la jeune amlie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn	147.5956
bonacieux	45.3186
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie  madame de villefort sighed her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet	22.5393
davrigny cried villefort i cannot tell you all i feel at this momentterror grief madness  yes said m davrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act	18.6321
give me your horse porthos	44.3925
what is the matter then he asked	7.9544
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dants on board the pharaon   how dreadful said mercds passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter  i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you  and the result of that letter  you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	95.8808
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days	32.5332
dartagnan cried athos my son i entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him	43.4792
chapter xlv	75.6864

live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions	15.5043
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was omitted  go on go on said dartagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come	33.8790
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him	36.5236
but my fears were this time ill founded i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded	34.5492
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo  pardieu everyone exists  doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses  have you seen the greek mistress  i have both seen and heard her	38.6349
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent	41.3786
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study	20.4423
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dants question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port	48.7655
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion	27.2249
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	133.3519
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back	26.2700
adieu	22.7198
dartagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door	8.3515
there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration	22.5070
so would you said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men	59.2888
in whom can i trust  place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger  but i must write  oh yes that is indispensable	71.8923
as to your rank an annual income of 50000 livres will enable you to support it admirably	15.1136
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	289.9173
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	20.1223
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried felton	25.8827
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them	22.7157
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknownwho hates slavery and finds himself ill placed in the world  aramis aramis cried dartagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt	40.8457
i dont care to be shot in a box  no said aramis he has not seen us	33.6758
ah there	123.9458
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself  come come enough of such compliments cried porthos	49.0089
we are lost  in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	23.5252
after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate	55.2032
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way	41.5264
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again	152.3939
it would be impossible to describe mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men	15.7725
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled	23.7233
dartagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword	12.0437
there were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench	32.4613
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry	19.7770
nobody but ourselves replied caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersindeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here  then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you  inconvenience us	71.7183
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal  it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars	23.7506
why did we not destroy the child with the mother  what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves	69.5583
my htel will be always open to you	54.7185
perhaps said athos but at all events listen well to this	42.9527
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop	7.7912
you do not know her replied the stranger	23.5793
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment	28.6773
richelieu   in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to rule  that paper must be torn to pieces said dartagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of death	48.4645
dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend	22.8102
it is too late	6.9786
is she your daughter  no mademoiselle said monte cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question	40.7313
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad augury	36.7984
as for me i feel anxious to preach a sermon said dartagnan	18.7469
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet  oh answered another voice which dartagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis	58.4369
will this be permitted me  certainly replied the officer and left the room	54.3895
take your glass then and let us drink	26.9004
after a moments mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears	12.6342
it remains here said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly	20.7534
from the time dartagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times dartagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	110.2941
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united  but where is such a lackey to be found  not to be found cried athos	102.5402
but what is the meaning of all these questions  to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services  oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid  sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes  how is that  i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it  what is it	28.1877
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	49.8929
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still  yes we	60.0002
what is it said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock	27.4533
tienne said he see why mademoiselle eugnie has asked me to meet her in the drawing room and why she makes me wait so long  having given this vent to his ill humor the baron became more calm mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawing room as the spot	74.7297
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond  stop a bit said aramis	33.8231
no false generosity count	42.7161
in the chamber of dartagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	30.6643
his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of dover	45.4397
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to youmisfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for youi would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure  sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score	143.4219
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets	17.3722
conferences	16.3636
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence	51.7898
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	26.7933
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly	57.0895
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul	23.4601
when they reached the street aramis said  well athos what do you think  of whom  pardieu	56.1664
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment	35.0472
i am betrayed on all sides	50.0181
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it	26.3433
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject  in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client	27.5669
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty	30.2297
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this i have the proofs  she was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force	50.2505
dartagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him	34.7093
the count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves  tis true  where can we find another sword asked porthos	42.5395
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example	49.1834
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	27.0074
yesyour friend at least hopes so  come upstairs with me and i will give it to you  i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	63.4502
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience  faith no  and you dartagnan  ii own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux	148.7907
it was indeed for him that they were there	23.4561
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian	55.4923
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up  true monsieur le comte replied dartagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	75.5536
you lie said the abb busoni with a tone of irresistible authority	14.8802
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small casket	15.9187
mademoiselle said eugnie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the hotel	40.3458
there he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination morrels petition m de villeforts marginal notes	7.8128
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag	47.2753
albert beauchamp and chteau renaud remained alone	58.7161
besides by the faith of bonacieux  you call yourself bonacieux interrupted dartagnan	64.8805
do you think athos will be sorry to see us  oh cried porthos oh	33.2875
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush	49.9269
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to dartagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly  oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer	79.7046
his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to come	54.9725
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse	17.9644
i am going to fire  gentlemen exclaimed dartagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are about	40.7139
mordaunt	77.0777
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	20.8118
have they then offered a large one inquired cromwell	93.8649
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party	15.8772
and he held out to the concierge the notarys order	17.5860
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard	29.8051
here i am said he	15.9468
farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st jean where state criminals were buried	21.7446
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately	6.1122
dartagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady	25.2342
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met  this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse	56.5615
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs	12.0408
the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before	31.8867
let them wait for me at the pomme de pin	11.1165
let us dispatch said the duke	12.1213
it is i shouted a voice	43.1193
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement	82.4271
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man	13.4210
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand  but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings example	85.2990
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	8.2855
i have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of dartagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon  but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him  no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	408.6024
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance	30.2915
who knows	25.8188
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret	18.0287
she read  it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	43.7012
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore	21.1780
well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	43.1489
from this point everything was a blank to dantshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	32.9878
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg work	18.8908
then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	13.0477
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slepta vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell	54.9686
you always say trifles my dear athos said dartagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never loved  the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as before	66.1629
0141m    so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man	9.7025
yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit	19.1479
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned  i am pleased sir to hear that  and the same also for monsieur du vallon  not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned  but you will be resigned my friend  never  he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself	87.8923
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another	22.0110
five minutes after m de trville was asking dartagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour	24.8337
i hate you and on my word you shall pay for this  at the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise her head and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried dear madame bonacieux open for me the little door on the alley and i will come down to you     chapter xviii	46.8204
its my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not	38.4653
as they went from the htel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrire de la villette and the other by the barrire montmartre to meet again beyond st denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results	99.6142
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table	64.6902
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	24.9194
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	34.2223
i shall go and die by his side  madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope  no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself	46.3870
carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino	8.4796
he pardoned and having pardoned he remained	67.4559
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me	39.8869
but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second  the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abb busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nmes  the story will be very long excellency  what matter	46.2152
on	74.7878
you very well know porthos that i continue to study theology for that purpose  he will be one as he says cried porthos he will be one sooner or later  sooner said aramis	59.8212
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him  oh	41.8950
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal	21.8041
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door	23.8152
i find england a charming country and i staybut on one condition only  what is it  that i am not forced to learn english  well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears usi believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again  so be it said dartagnan but ii confess i have a contrary conviction  our good dartagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye  but in the meantime saves the country added athos	241.4883
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall	33.0387
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine	16.0873
the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around dartagnan and his companions	179.0058
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on	16.2858
this circumstance pleased m de trville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m de la trmouilles testimony and himself	40.5932
14  the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters	71.3438
and my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen i expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him  gave him cried dartagnan	30.0620
what is he looking at	26.9654
three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear	41.4978
dartagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent	23.2926
andrea was gone	31.6739
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mothers jewel case  you think then i have something to dread asked dartagnan	82.1663
come said boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me  perhaps he knows you though you do not know him m de monte cristo knows everybody  five millions  here is his receipt	251.2283
you would not fight a duel asked albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory	29.3000
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean debray chteau renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit	115.6358
do you think it will be long before he comes in  no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock  well i will go and take a turn in the champs lyses and at ten oclock i will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me  you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin	59.3818
you are a christian you are my sister in religion	48.5531
oh where will be the end  villefort rushed into the room	50.5858
she raised her head with an effort	20.4197
now said the steward what have you to tell me  and you said andrea	25.2185
he then repaired to dartagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own	62.3659
now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and cannot be legally exercised  the notary then prepared to retire	37.2222
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours  my lord said dartagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i cannot miss  do not be uneasy said mazarin it is the same  good thought dartagnan i fancied it was so  return then at five oclock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you	36.0465
and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred  no my dear vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them  20214m    gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome  franz and albert bowed	40.0375
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor	79.3461
dartagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it	28.5111
come my friend come let me embrace you	25.5322
how much in that little bag  seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs  seven thousand livres cried porthos	46.7127
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	97.1116
do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love  true replied franz	52.2447
on recognizing her step mother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed	21.9833
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner	27.3307
here is m franz dpinay said he you requested to see him	21.3502
yes my lord replied the young man confused	13.5847
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo	16.6085
ah for the sake of our child let me live  50167m    no no no i tell you one day if i allow you to live you will perhaps kill him as you have the others  ii kill my boy cried the distracted mother rushing toward villefort i kill my son	75.5338
how	37.1503
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through arras	29.8185
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity	30.3622
be assured then of seeing me soon return   capital cried athos you are the king of poets my dear aramis	37.2097
for life replied porthos in the same manner	25.2850
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	188.0736
nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day	55.6353
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness	35.6297
at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition  0279m    under pretence of being fatigued dants asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade	25.3925
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner	45.9775
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that  i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet	113.8032
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy	51.4907
an hour afterwards they returned	18.6777
m coquenard firm upon his legs would have declined all relationship with m porthos	29.9822
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed  oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness  from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading csars commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander	167.1820
she had only one day left	41.7592
athos came down last and found dartagnan already on horseback and growing impatient	82.3743
20355m    scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars  dear herminei have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today	261.9012
decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think	30.0430
one may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens	23.7761
you know there are different sorts  that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute	76.8528
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone	19.5372
the door opened and a dim light reached dants eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand	35.6781
m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	18.6770
pardon for whom cried he	104.5491
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes  let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the csars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument  as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	251.9602
adieu  and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he saidmonte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed	36.6119
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	47.7929
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper	58.8071
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire  hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible  at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	30.6680
two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after her	39.4593
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against dartagnanprojects lost in the distance of the future	22.8868
oh cried mme	78.0667
you have no longer a weapon and besides i am on my guard	24.5792
my friends thats exactly like me	45.1068
not at all i assure you  but where will you manage to stow me  in the chamber overhead  surely that is where you yourselves sleep  never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room  caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment	18.7434
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma	22.0701
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention	22.4393
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais  dartagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation	70.9103
porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches	14.5352
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	9.2424
a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated	41.6669
but tell me all about it  why do you wish to know asked cavalcanti	29.4085
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled	31.6908
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair	9.5505
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre but jest as he might he gained nothing	42.9792
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work	20.9119
at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot	30.5923
the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity	14.8296
porthos maintained a majestic silence	21.2957
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea	18.2316
he continued  so i was going away but he called me back	46.1367
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine  a name	33.2277
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage	23.8975
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person  yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues  well can i see porthos  certainly monsieur	24.5152
bonacieux hesitated to continue	51.4582
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it	54.6953
no sir  i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church  he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	86.2034
as for me i will give my last sou for it	15.6648
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he  he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling  i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you  of me  yes of you  and pray what may it be  well to take his part  ah my dear sir	85.2745
i have happily only myself in the world to care for  but what makes you sigh  my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy  you are not happy porthos	55.6618
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business  the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them	35.8203
1f3	79.5956
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion  prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades	23.1921
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of ablard and hlose placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertakers men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial	105.2805
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the dukes tone toward hernow that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine  have you enemies then asked richelieu	177.5435
the host opened	93.6992
i have the price and dartagnan threw the bag upon the table	27.0702
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded	17.0009
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle  my dear dherblayi learned from dartagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord	284.5659
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied	15.1306
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace	220.7787
every soldier must be ambitious must he not	68.9482
have you a name then  i bear that of your brother  ay but you are mistaken	27.6691
were i but of gentle birth  the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties	24.3672
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dants	64.8372
adieu then till we meet again said valentine tearing herself away	15.6762
listen i am already upon the scent resumed dartagnan	36.6157
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation	13.0514
dartagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	20.9070
by her step she must be young perhaps she is pretty	89.0313
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank	13.9861
thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well  so far so well answered planchet alighting and extending his arms to mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton	387.5955
all is well i thank you now leave us alone mr felton     chapter l chat between brother and sister   during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sister in laws fauteuil milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen	168.1094
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it	23.3291
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition  real interrupted the count smiling	34.7640
very well sir said comminges you shall hear of this anon  and you of me sir said louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest  friquet and nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects	51.8420
edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm	31.6626
as for aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the kings presence	30.5890
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon	76.7900
you know the rest  milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed	32.3274
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation	12.2304
i cant leave you alone in this abominable country  thanks my worthy friend	24.8169
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn	13.9379
its little enough  but so it is  no it cannot be  are you my friend caderousse  yes in life or death  well i will tell you a secret  what is it  but remember  ah	93.0207
most likely said dartagnan i am one of his most faithful servants  it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england  yes a certain dartagnan a barnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london  do you know him personally asked the governor	33.6704
what the devil are you doing here count  accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee	11.2311
her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty	29.2663
the duc de beaufort	8.2613
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven	36.6962
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it  and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	40.0651
see	12.9897
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon  ah my dear m cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends  i am at your service sir replied the major	73.3296
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again  friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth	45.1853
this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is	16.0951
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand  which means  good day sir	3.1538
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer	47.8999
well madame said de winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants	27.0728
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing	25.3805
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket  the casket would encumber you	34.3851
you were writing  i  your fingers are stained with ink  ah true i was writing	60.1055
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	13.4949
he has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life	37.5249
i was worn out with fatigue	32.9071
but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not  oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for	141.7843
and such magnificent hair	94.8053
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him	74.0079
patrick soon caught the sound of his masters voice calling his falcon	16.7131
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano  the prisoner started and bit his lips	4.6358
exactly  and you have that letter of the cardinal said dartagnan	23.0856
de morcerfs who is deceased  for what reason  because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired  and what are they to live upon  the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army  50113m    well i must confess these are scruples  i registered their deed of gift yesterday  and how much did they possess  oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs	415.6741
but now we must part	80.1217
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugnie  what does that signify so long as they favor your suit  but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary	91.0801
at this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek him	16.2200
i shall kill himi cannot help it	29.8260
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead	43.3488
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	19.9913
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun	33.9068
but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps death  heheincur danger of death	21.9506
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy  but why must you leave me so soon  i do not know particulars	72.8202
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed dartagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way dartagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock	38.2903
there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile	35.7360
a ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead	12.9200
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused	75.2657
pity me	3.9136
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way	122.1216
married at eighteen to m bonacieux having always lived among her husbands friendspeople little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her positionmme	27.6363
athos was pale and trembled in every limb	20.4882
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained	44.8900
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it	53.0527
it was as we have said the 1st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness	16.9364
do not fear pardieu we are alone  i think i have discovered my father  your true father  yes  not old cavalcanti  no for he has gone again the true one as you say  and that father is  well caderousse it is monte cristo  bah  yes you understand that explains all	94.1764
i have two horsesi do not count my servants bobtailed nag	14.8071
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden	24.5649
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you  and on what will you sleep said dartagnan	55.3446
by the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying fire	16.8921
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim	149.5726
they have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in passing	20.9826
go away now mouston  so hes called mouston thought dartagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton  well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	411.3985
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance	12.2347
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens	43.7912
at six oclock the curate of st merri was announced	11.5216
she descended and went through the passage	82.4048
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife	24.0100
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle	18.5761
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait  dartagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended	50.9394
villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections	232.2882
then said dartagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do  yes said athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen  athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman	38.3728
but you general were you not at whitehall  no said cromwell	46.9405
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	13.1269
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste	39.4706
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty	51.6392
alas alas sir have pity on me  the old mans eyes remained fixed on the door	18.2141
that is what i want  come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better  do you think so m bossuet	55.7970
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound  and grimaud threw the dagger on the table	112.4458
him i can place at your disposal it is count de rochefort  i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris  my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette  and wherefore has he not been to see me  he was toldmy lord will pardon me  certainly speak  that your lordship was about to treat with the court  gondy bit his lips	43.3613
but let us be quickthe king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort levque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in  m de trville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort levque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him	86.2673
but suggested dartagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos  yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably  here	185.5369
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet	122.3254
both were addressed to king charles	26.9003
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see	35.3646
help me gentlemen cried dartagnan we must break in this door  it is the devil in person said aramis hastening forward	35.8904
each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent	61.6854
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	27.8953
it must be done said athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	17.4232
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	38.4349
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m and madame danglars will think me a very ill mannered person	46.6128
whats that cried the duke	14.1768
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner	44.3755
besides said the abb god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge  do you then believe in god said caderousse	72.1205
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day	15.0384
i beseech you  the superior and mme	127.3664
it seems you must always be playing some game or other  yes and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take	30.6935
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis	27.1067
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him	45.1504
but although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	11.2125
at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means	63.6579
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with  all sir  have you the keys  they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions  very well and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you you may go  but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken it is only fifty thousand francs everything included  and your fee  is included in this sum  but have you not come from auteuil here  yes certainly  well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal	155.4612
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises  charles had heard and understood it all	32.4853
i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost	28.2912
as for m de trville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment	32.7942
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of dartagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders	53.2779
begone then  dartagnan saluted m de trville who held out his hand to him dartagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude	25.3397
if it be so we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position  and if it were an interrogatory replied the cardinal	40.5662
but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father  40100m    no but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted  at the words i will beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments	222.3741
but my dear count has m danglars any reason  ah	39.0199
now you talk my dear  you pardon me  we shall see said porthos majestically and the two separated saying till this evening  the devil thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenards strongbox at last     chapter xxxv	52.0496
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness  20081m    oh they are simple enough replied the host	20.2934
hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of st gervais and do not bow too low to this italian that might give him a poor idea of you  good answered porthos	85.4472
he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there	38.8166
albert is ten minutes after time  there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant  how imprudent said chteau renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him  and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat	67.7960
the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention	37.4047
with the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence	28.3368
i am the bearer of a letter that is all	15.3510
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man	14.5170
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments	37.7478
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go  i shall never swim again replied faria	35.8382
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	41.1466
50183m    are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile	11.5207
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons	25.7244
adieu valentine adieu said morrel bowing	26.4612
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme	71.1528
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news said he	34.9478
the president again arose and having imposed silence saidsir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedif you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence  and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidi will not swear  then you must die replied the president calmly	486.2335
monte cristo seemed in despair	34.3394
besides they felt that the dnouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	34.3045
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him	28.7934

no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	40.9519

but this confession concerns me only	29.7796
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows	70.2244

leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me  monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance  dartagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athoss last remark he stopped short	53.6540

dartagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	78.6133
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder	30.1603
you are monsieur dartagnan  you see monsieur that you say it again  but i tell you monsieur commissary cried bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter	48.8077

because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what i mean  yes sir	20.6022
what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection  an abdication repeated anne i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated  well replied mazarin and am i not almost a kingking indeed of france	37.8607

chapter lxxx	72.8465
m noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	62.6803
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs lyses and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure  maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence	32.9410

finish mouston finish the work cried porthos	15.1616
i wish them to be promulgated immediately  but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply  that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no man  will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain  you are right mr jackson replied buckingham	390.0205
dartagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms	31.4900

next morning dartagnan was the first to rise	19.2834
nay dear mother say the accused person	102.0674
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head	16.7450
he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth it was dark but at eleven oclock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion	92.6946
the coadjutor alone obtained nothing	105.7737
be it so	38.6865
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night	62.3070
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps  may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself  if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us  youre right yes let us go  on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	489.1284
and kill him said porthos	54.2217
my very self replied planchet but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud  proud toward an old friend	28.0752
on the following morning at five oclock dartagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mothers recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor dartagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow	113.8074
i must divert my attention  amuse yourself with milady my dear dartagnan i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse you  hear me athos said dartagnan	76.7724
you chevalier dherblay to his left	57.9438
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st marks column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the chteau dif	35.6291
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	27.8004
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment  yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off  as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen	120.3315
ali is the supper ready  at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room	50.3946
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	123.7920
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast	10.6217
parry was not wrong	34.7095
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible  does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday  grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent	21.5953
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others	5.9642
the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his eyes	43.8791
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time	52.8390
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	28.0487
bonacieux starting	177.4067
you here at this hour said she	70.4327
gods death dont fire screamed dartagnan throwing open the window	13.9138
horrible replied raoul especially in expression  yes yes said de guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost  well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor	264.5848
ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saint mrans death	24.2155
i told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you why have you not done so  they are below sire and with your permission la chesnaye will bid them come up  yes yes let them come up immediately	26.9847

aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography	17.1194
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you  what will you do in a foreign land an enemys country  i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and aramis too knows something of the language	123.7992

we must go and find lord winter  they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for	26.6768
now continued faria addressing dants with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	20.3552
patrick uttered a loud cry	13.2614
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you	28.2454
ah	24.0177

but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children  madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	81.8905
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival	22.2768
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me  to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	47.6331
she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and viscountess of morcerf	57.0591
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants	56.8502
yes but i am expecting some one a friend of athos  a friend exclaimed the count	35.2825
my lord the cardinal  mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors	24.1750
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man	12.6412
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart	53.6373
take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain let go the bowlins haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards  20041m    that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker  his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start	79.4276
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abb is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planches anti spasmodics and mint and hoffmans drops are among my favorite remedies	63.6439
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic	49.6284
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner	21.5842
porthos   instead of returning directly home dartagnan alighted at the door of m de trville and ran quickly up the stairs	13.8918
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor  villefort looked at the count almost with terror	49.5396
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness  what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	54.9427
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness	19.7755
these individuals are under arrest	47.9393
he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman	95.8604
it was dark and silent as the tomb	32.3342
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor  there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarins purpose	77.4607
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute	170.1741
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her	27.5175
only remember thisif you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen i am quite sure however we may threaten you you are lost at these words he threw me a crown which i picked up and he took the ladder	125.8809
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	40.1415
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but  say on  but since you go out with hayde and sometimes even take her to the opera  well  i think i may venture to ask you this favor  you may venture to ask me anything  well then my dear count present me to your princess  i will do so but on two conditions  i accept them at once  the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview  very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not  the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers  i give you my oath that i will not  enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not	356.7221
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones	9.4446
take it and there ends the matter  what cried athos are you selling my horsemy bajazet	22.5654
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us  and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion  mousqueton smiled disdainfully	56.7407
now really let me ask sir have youdo you believe you have anything to do	29.4215
is she french  no a venetian  and her name is  countess g  ah i know her by name exclaimed albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty	150.9048
no i did not say i was a stranger to you	16.6215
yes and without violence said louise	69.9273
triple ass said athos rising but he sank down again immediately	18.5780
dartagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returnedstood stillstruck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed  i recollect  what inquired dartagnan	73.1430
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago  20203m    no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	32.8508
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment	36.6432
lord de winter exclaimed the count	5.2805
anne frowned	78.2829
so let us go and get killed where we are told to go	40.2644
for my part i wash my hands of the affair  so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather	80.2937
his father  yes his father replied the abb his right name was noirtier de villefort  at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dants and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before	58.7251
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m de wardes	31.8847
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	13.5230

i saw him today for the first time and he can tell you on what occasion he came to demand the rent of my lodging	31.7213
then m de trville made a sign with his hand and all retired except dartagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place	21.1703
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	16.5108

come  milady opened the window and made a sign to mme	17.7864
little flirtations perhaps and thats all	31.8195
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la rserve and which had the postmark marseilles 27th february delivery 6 oclock pm  but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be	115.4735
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill	50.0858
grimaud fellprecipitated into the moat	17.3978
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you	18.2082
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir	49.2630
m de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant	29.2073

then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way	56.1331
he turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said come i will not abandon you thus	14.6821
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him	12.7014
my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton	39.9203
then listen said he	44.3647
de morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yaninano said morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies hayde whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me said she	25.0519
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found  no athos no you are mistaken said dartagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant	56.5395

la jeune amlie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible	16.9008

the vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast	57.6861
and now let everyone retire  must i go too asked valentine timidly	50.3022
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come	49.2557
dartagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him	17.4470
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	24.0204
but to her great surprise dartagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos  yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better  when will you do that  immediately i hope  ah	105.6027
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you  noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart	31.4761
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life  andrea visibly changed countenance	210.9705
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana	30.6632

i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours	34.5272
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	9.7847
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither	32.9420
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all  your mother would die of grief  my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame  are you quite decided albert  yes let us go  but do you think we shall find the count at home  he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home  they ordered the driver to take them to no	55.1193
this was m morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened	84.7319
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	29.4750
chapter xxxiii	104.1410
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune i do not think that m dpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	28.3765
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol	27.9016
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	33.2434
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire	35.7652
the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great	36.7666
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice  and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists  if he persists said the cardinal	102.7027
presently they heard milady retire to her room	68.8944
what then have i to fear from him  you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life	42.9062
ah	42.0937
you do not know your own good fortune  and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing	18.1911
then turning toward the second musketeer dartagnan said  monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety  the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	52.4681
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes	15.7466
presently the door opened and she perceived felton	15.1879
a rich englishman continued the abb who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on dants upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dants had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement	88.9640
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol	36.3765
hunting for the equipments   the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly dartagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos	111.2641
you will take your place in the coup to chlons	24.2090
just so replied aramis	30.6462
but in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry	225.8756
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wont be any parliament at all  and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament  colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it	32.2106
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you  indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit  yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven oclock  then you have received full information concerning my arrival  of course  ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten  30119m    what precaution  that of informing you beforehand of my coming  oh no it has not  but you are sure you are not mistaken  very sure  it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening  i will prove it to you beyond a doubt  oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble  yes yes said monte cristo	49.4814
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages	52.4414
a circle was immediately formed around the door	35.4522
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so	58.0514
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugnie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti danglars kept up the title of prince	31.8927
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherds life was vampas reply	16.5026
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dants did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth  how is that  because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery  what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty  what has become of him	97.5542
i have not forgotten all i owe thee	35.9306
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man	67.8849
this doctor has a niece continued aramis	37.3263
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet dartagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme	56.1919
i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortunealone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet	13.6258
dartagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away	22.4398
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses	22.2237
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin	13.9309
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel	10.6160
did you not say she was dead  three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved	32.5544
the stranger met julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him	39.1179
the count does not know  how should i know	27.5800
it is enough	29.8414
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph	25.0522
well  one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant  art thou sure said the man in the cloak	61.1636
i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home	54.1582
havent you some one who will relieve me of my horse  groslow whistled and a sailor appeared	38.6008
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open	26.4852
do you know count that persons of our time of lifenot that you belong to the class you are still a young manbut as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year	56.4986
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips	18.7265
in his eyes and to his conviction mme	59.0751
you would like one that sails as rapidly as  lightning interrupted mordaunt	54.3054
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	29.3487
do you regret them asked morrel with his open laugh	41.8814
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go	15.2966
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach london with the king	32.7099
pre pamphile more wine  and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	8.5145
it was four oclock when dants was placed in this chamber	26.1653
dartagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abb dherblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend	52.8892
i dont need the quarter of such a sumi who am still only in the guardsand by selling my saddles i shall procure it	25.8447
and what does it concern thenmy captivity  i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited  you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him	141.6275
yes i  and why you  because i alone know  what  that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears  indeed said milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for i really cannot tell what you mean  and she looked at dartagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away	85.8428
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	44.0977
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him	55.7137
your interview will be private	112.5747
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	77.6039
0057m    danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him  certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dants arrested	94.4490
do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned	55.1525
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand	48.2601
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim  are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled  several persons hurried up to m de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy	84.7334
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	18.9543
some years only	284.6366
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached	14.2224
by leaving this light on the right he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find it	47.7193
shot my dear boy	24.6332
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped	29.4822
we have made our calculations with spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred livres  four times fifteen makes sixtysix thousand livres said athos	24.7907
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said morrel with a smile full of grief i am under his orders for the next month  oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said julie	44.2941
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table	31.7056
noirtier for whom france was a vast chess board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmatedm	26.4770
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness	31.5363
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel	218.9714
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop then he passed into the dressing room which he examined	19.8515
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor	75.1827
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him	27.2129
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are  no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man	44.3669
swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited	33.4616
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power	66.8978
oh its nothing nothing cried milady	81.2788
bonacieux would have any suspicion	35.2203
hlose he cried	22.3899
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage  the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris	60.6148
m debray has made me lose 700000 francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250000 livres and do as all bankrupts dodisappear	37.8329
no replied athos fortunately monsieur dartagnan has only fainted  ah indeed so much the better said lord de winter	18.0461
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon	27.1505
no quarter cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them tremble	70.7892
do you wish him to read it said valentine	21.5264
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks  the count repeated eugnie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully pale  i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out	26.9404
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againa face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercds my betrothed  40268m    the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry  edmond dants  then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligiblehome home  the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived	582.6897
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information  and you replied to him with that notion  nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him  but if he be a spy  what do you think a spy would be about here	97.3406
porthos looked very melancholy	50.0033
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances  and now i am convinced said dartagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris  the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration	109.3299

they traced her to chlons and there they lost her  they lost her  yes forever  madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail	184.0423
alas i have only my tongue but i will try to show that it is good for something	31.4894
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way  perhaps replied dartagnan	24.3499
was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind  my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	34.7878
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	82.4775
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated	13.1677
to what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind  now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everythingthanks and compliments we have plenty of time to spare  the two friends recalled by dartagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn	701.1310
you rochefort	442.6158
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile	34.7885
my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna	15.4230
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria	38.1161
go monsieur duke and return often	121.7877
but one word more count  what is it  advice  be careful advice is worse than a service  oh you can give me this without compromising yourself  tell me what it is  is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres  that is the sum m danglars himself announced  must i receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary  this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance  because said andrea with a certain ill concealed uneasiness i thought i heard my father in law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now  well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve months	194.0407
anne de bueil	6.7216
can you not tell me his name  at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs	14.0956
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully	20.4774
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball	49.7354
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	56.9373
the abb dherblay	37.2336
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time  sit down said the old man	23.8926
the hostess as she entered saw dartagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon dartagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly	24.7178
good said monte cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier  and you leave us said julie at a moments warning	22.4331
at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible	18.8610
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing	34.3863
while he was doing this dartagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared	62.0700
the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen  no  he looked to mebut tis impossible  at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said  the passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass  the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission	70.9828

a lieutenant in the corsican battalion  a soldier of the usurper then  a soldier of the french army  well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword  you are mistaken monsieur i replied he has perished by the poniard  what do you want me to do asked the magistrate	76.9246
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river  thats well said dartagnan	16.3629
no all is over said porthos	48.2604
dartagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply	20.3037
when he compared the public crimes of this ministerstartling crimes european crimes if so we may saywith the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life	152.8182
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseauyou rememberthe mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger	31.8530
suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters voice	13.5025
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dants pressing his hand to his throbbing brows	5.4232
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed	89.7640
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitors cross that lesser criminals were executed	8.7565
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright	38.4335
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile  madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties  so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse	73.5978
i love you so tenderly that i cannot help being jealous even of the past  a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	42.0585
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation	44.1845

a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions	24.2163
so so replied porthos	87.4863
the anjou wine   after the most disheartening news of the kings health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward	70.7051
preceded by ali who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristos companion in italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself	30.5339
csar poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tigers	31.4360
chapter lix	36.2168
there they are  the coachman turning around gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain	20.8587
in that case i can give you proofs  no sir said dartagnan and we place ourselves at your orders  well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal	35.6673
good it is by my side	51.3549
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	3.1852
as soon as he arrives inform me	8.2815
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse	211.8609
in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double locked carrying off the key  ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery  no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution  and was the sum a large one  it was not money  ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant  yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box	61.2058
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter	10.7446
no no i would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise	20.9233
how much have we louise  the young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twenty three bank notes	61.0027
i have given you all i have and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack  but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time  yes but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london  i answer for bazin said aramis	33.3532
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him  oh father i exclaimed you are very good  but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation  i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me	30.8225
grimaud he cried remain i wish it  then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed he saluted and made a movement to depart	59.7235
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc	36.3074
ah im ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by mahomet	51.5639
but the latter went on without pity  seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence  doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	68.7640
bonacieux	51.2497
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	22.6034
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation	35.9000
it is not aramis cried he	28.4975
ah	63.4042
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of bthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to	28.0785
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed	34.4156
ah indeed said cavalcanti	108.0461
i have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living	34.9411
once only had villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his fathers name	73.1058
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way  thats true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man	29.2567
the ambassadors	1079.4452
will your eminence please read and examine  i am acquainted with it  sign it then  reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence  monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given  suppose i refuse  then said dartagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal  would you dare to touch a cardinal  you have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musketeers  the queen will revenge me gentlemen  i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us  how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis	366.5092
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything  there was a brief silence the abb rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	95.7422
dartagnan will give each of us his instructions	80.0483
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	61.6987
0059m    when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him	77.2666
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards  oh no of course not	132.4093
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures	91.6793
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them	26.6256
oh youll know it someday aramis but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctors niece  aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening	106.9195
he is saved	53.9357
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met dartagnan who having seen all was coming to him	42.5144
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	13.0059
has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance  no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance  to whom did he give up his sword  he did not give it up he broke it  he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage  there was a momentary pause	90.6870
chapter 22 the smugglers  dants had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast	43.0044
oh dear yes sir the abbs dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonapartes emissariesone of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man  indeed said the englishman	113.1825
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation i did not sleep well  you raoul not sleep well	44.7586
monsieur dartagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns	20.2496
he pressed the counts hand and left	28.9419

where are you murmured coquenard and he tried to smile	27.8541
the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe	28.5479
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal	19.2420
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken  and what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked	58.4187
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangoisse	16.0278
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad  but if he does not come said dartagnan	29.9088
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back	55.0277
but i could find nothingabsolutely nothing	22.4411
how strong one feels here said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands	32.6708
besides he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of m and madame de saint mran her mothers parents who both love her tenderly  and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m noirtier said madame de villefort besides they are to come to paris in about a month and valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m noirtier  the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition	68.9719
look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abb and then observe the lines traced on the wall	29.4276
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to dartagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening  planchet cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	24.0811
i will have him come in if you really wish it  athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back	57.7326
none on my word	28.8078
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town	39.8289
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here  he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him	37.9184
you know the marquis of saint mran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival  yes said monte cristo i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them  but that is not all  not all  no they were going to marry their daughter  to m franz dpinay	37.7132
yes you are right maximilian i will follow you	14.4082
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541 contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by us federal laws and your states laws	23.5648
that will be sufficient  you think so  certainly  very well then  if they should hear of the separation  ah yes what could i say  that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family  by the corsinari  precisely	64.4104
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 1000 francs for a mouthful of bread	29.0404
athos pointed to the bastion	29.8862
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart	11.4391
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	28.2788
the baron was completely roused	38.7938
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave  i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger  go then sir and god keep you  the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops palace	116.1176
an opportunity will come replied rochefort	120.9674
tomorrow then monsieurtomorrow  till then god preserve your majesty  however ill the king might sleep m de trville slept still worse	26.9925

i love you as one loves a father brother husband	82.6226
chapter lxxvii	87.5276
felton had not spoken	32.1513
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercds  nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	69.8898
he knows all	56.1835
but enough of money matters	104.4105
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct	26.0728
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her	30.2097
the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade	20.3954
help help he murmured oh god	80.9624
m de monte cristo yields his right of using his  we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion	40.3389
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis	34.4311
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance	39.1535
what the deuce can you expect	30.2783
im no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own	22.0788
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur dherblay	26.7812
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding	35.6324
now pass your arm through this opening  why  you will know presentlypass it  porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	41.6161
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events	119.6316
shall we go together  you annoyed count said beauchamp and by what  ah you think very lightly of it i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house  what brief  the one m de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassinsome brigand escaped from the gallows apparently  true said beauchamp i saw it in the paper	201.7332
well my dear dants are you now free inquired the owner	49.4906
i know because it is my office to know everything	53.5804
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort	45.5618
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her	18.7180
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse	38.4200
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	60.5753
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping	40.9258
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured	45.8049
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	27.0591
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear	33.1252
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if i am not dead i shall have seen you again madameeven if i have to overturn the world and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment	111.8219
a ball had passed through his breast	39.1772
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him  oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20000 francs a month  it is magnificent	47.0113
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service	18.6520
from whom comes this letter  from her majesty as i think  from her majesty said buckingham becoming so pale that dartagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal	38.2493
escaped	85.6938
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house	34.5134
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress  indeed beauchamp you are unbearable	46.5457
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer	34.4385
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend	21.4453
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti	12.4820
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor	54.2381
all my researches have been useless	24.0545
have we relations with the court	29.4626
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lions skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time	688.1177
nothing replied bonacieux nothing	100.6354

mme	93.3352
what is that said he whence comes that cry  from the wounded mans room replied the host	27.5875
does your excellency wish me to accompany him  no the coachman ali and baptistin will go  the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars	89.0803
what is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queens head	29.6988
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him  bear with him whispered aramis it is doubtless some spy  after my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man i shall hear you with pleasure sir  the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king	62.4505
to morrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy  but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men  monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won  then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight	113.2768
