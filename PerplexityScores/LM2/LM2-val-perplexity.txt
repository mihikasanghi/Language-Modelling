bravo planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master i will promise you a place in my service oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur dartagnan at the same time dartagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand	75.7953
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one <unk> her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting	1166.5898
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of cannon	132.5681

aramis suffering at once in body and mind had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him that is to say the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder	214.8179
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his <unk> <unk> bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly <unk> in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind	1093.9305
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly	91.7615

and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the <unk> milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes	34.9553
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now <unk> matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears	164.3973
ah dants my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried	217.8911

if this ship <unk> like the others he is a ruined man and has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abb	339.4808
here monsieur mazarin is everything does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england oh no	314.3005
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	2031.8986
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and rene in waiting	419.3524
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to <unk> himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a <unk> trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that <unk> above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand	420.1312
yes yes replied dants eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy <unk> to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abb	137.7077
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it	108.5742
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous <unk> gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother	327.3819
large <unk> of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the <unk> of the room were simple but in excellent taste	737.5156

and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and <unk> of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been <unk> up to a height of six feet	51.3634
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house	34.0764

mousqueton was a norman whose pacific name of <unk> his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton	2220.2505
nay that he can almost work a miracle	327.5105
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person	111.5486
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	596.5573
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance	195.9418
men are so made and we are not always twenty years old	95.8844
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of <unk> your majesty on your side said dartagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been you are in error sir answered the queen	248.2981
at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice and said i want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon as to the man to be depended upon i have him under my hand monsieur said m dessessart pointing to dartagnan and as to the four or five volunteers monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be wanting four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said dartagnan raising his sword	58.6314
at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times	44.0237
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince	706.8839
oh it is not yet fixed murmured fernand	686.2067
i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars <unk> ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	304.7110
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to m dessessart and inform him of his promotion	176.0831
the count sat down	48.8857
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over	115.5924
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said dartagnan	132.5099
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	2301.1838
but what happened after my departure how can i tell said kitty	112.9370
but the dead cannot return their fire certainly not	276.9871

the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse	366.3041

take my advice renounce this woman	421.9839
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber	19.2461
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice	173.3479
so you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause	1337.9592
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at boulogne <unk> <unk> and promise me to set out to morrow morning i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave mordaunt bowed	71.8827

the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive	165.7348
mazarin leaned out of the window	46.9761
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	93.8973
where must we place him demanded the chief	292.5934
is he accompanied yes by a lackey named lubin we will keep a sharp lookout for them and if we lay hands on them his eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to paris under a good escort and by doing so monsieur the governor said dartagnan you will deserve well of the cardinal shall you see him on your return monsieur count without a doubt tell him i beg you that i am his humble servant i will not fail delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to dartagnan	459.2137

they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so <unk> to him produced the same effect as formerly	1018.6566

yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to <unk> account in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be softened	78.6317

bring me a carafe of water said the abb	180.1852

dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	42.1545

but no on reflection the procureur was not a <unk> man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from <unk> association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law	218.9311

one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude	717.1612
has <unk> been killed	416.3404
to london cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in london that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to me but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none nor i said aramis	26.8395
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled	1685.1483
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks	50.1164
did you say he was coming yes summoned by m de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m danglars is to see mademoiselle eugnie settled	121.4053
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was <unk> had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish	260.9602
gaetano departed with the reply	312.5421
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the barons house there has been a misunderstanding what with the baroness no with the baron has he perceived anything ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness	206.3756
who asked his eminence	114.8792
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	50.9546
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his <unk> and particularly the moment when that <unk> had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty	433.9848
no monsieur le comte answered the servant i think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes	40.4608
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty	444.4695
there was a moments <unk> was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body	96.6613
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let	32.3728
what is it listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbs two hiding places	235.9239
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural ma foi said chteau renaud i would rather end my career like m de morcerf a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe and moreover it kills said beauchamp	260.0671
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good <unk> he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	336.5211
oh why did i not tell you all	28.9326
monsieur du tremblay received dartagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	158.6608
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of <unk>	259.4895
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after alberts departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy	320.0299
upon this promise dartagnan withdrew and the next day he began service	304.1887
touching <unk> cried dartagnan which well becomes good citizens like us	632.8450
monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry toward <unk> and monsieur de chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie	445.8497
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression	194.1254
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column	210.0376
i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton he will not escape the chastisement he deserves felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of <unk> which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and whom the puritans styled simply satan	51.7924
youve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven	109.5426
the people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd	335.1388
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty	135.1418
they proceeded thus to <unk>	1176.6372
he forgot the necessary <unk> of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of milady	1966.9990
you know her it seems said chteau renaud	39.7312
the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother	91.7460
the keeper relaxed his hold	1625.8151
dartagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre	106.9234
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity	305.8517
it was a melancholy <unk> of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement	412.2148
the jailer advanced dants appeared not to perceive him	354.8028
the four friends followed him	15.8334
and signed by <unk> the king and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt	59.7597
but <unk> for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv	274.2987
as to that cried dartagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured how so i will go this very evening to trville whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brother in law monsieur dessessart but another thing what asked dartagnan seeing that mme	104.8041
who rang asked valentine	1095.1052
come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed	73.2418
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak	274.7298
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon	393.0398
thus the attention of many was attracted by this <unk>	686.5982
once upon a time there lived a <unk> powerful <unk> reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well	1471.5720
what	82.0336
at this instant they heard the sound of horses feet	33.1184
la ramee stretched out his legs grimaud took a table cloth tore it into <unk> and tied la ramees feet together	650.8090
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length	309.9995
a man can easily be put out of the way there then it is indeed the bagdad and <unk> of the thousand and one nights	167.5397
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea you love me yes i do or may the devil take me	129.3488
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court	291.2453
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his <unk> that woman must live she must repent and <unk> my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the <unk> of my house	641.0699
shall i help you madame asked athos	85.1784
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular	252.0565
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de <unk> or desdemona	425.1111
but proceed i beg of you	158.8356
if you do escape remember that the poor abb whom all the world called mad was not so	206.2304
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	68.8988
have they offered you money	234.5036
in the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded	88.0983
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	241.3804
all was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless	472.8098
an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii	189.9968
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care	106.4031
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge	228.2674
yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renes the <unk> and later probably that of baron de <unk> whose story has been so <unk> by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count	1042.1825
my words have not convinced you	350.6160
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius recall le <unk> <unk> villequier and <unk> said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys	1015.7343
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence	67.1742
count said he i thank you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer but i must return to paris what has happened a great misfortune more important to me than life	146.1620
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo	241.4751
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp	225.7613
what do you think of that exploit my lord it is magnificent said mazarin thoughtfully	121.1211
valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help	302.2613
has mankind treated me as a brother	2264.3774
holloa there some bread he called	193.2531
it was evident that there was clamor and sedition	296.6961
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	52.7298
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this doubtless doubtless athos	123.8379
he perceived in the tavern a <unk> boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a <unk>	222.3139
let us wait by all means	64.7132
it was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave paris by night had been circulated	291.2789
send him away and all will then be well what do you wish me to do oh madame	34.8416
the porter got up as eugnie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately	176.6917
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door	80.8391
this knife was my only hope	116.9658
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated	71.7192
now since dartagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way	103.4199
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff	983.3621
what are you thinking of dartagnan he began	30.9831
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum	469.3387
i was not rich my life was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret the president frowned imperceptibly	92.7870
it is very evident that it is the letter <unk> which m noirtier wants said the notary	126.6716
athoss horse where is that in the stable how much is it worth fifty pistoles at most its worth eighty	249.6148
shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess	101.7244
accept my <unk> for the example you have set me and which i intend following	496.3833
yes my prince but listen	205.4628
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	952.5311
my captain is dead i have barely escaped but i am a good sailor	199.7132
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by <unk> of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing	190.8546
i accelerate your ruin	443.2691
oh no self love beauchamp	1555.1171
they employ him because they are afraid of him	162.4374
i also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons for a thousand pistoles for a thousand <unk> that amount the beggar not one too many and you have them they are here upon my word i think he acted very generously generously	76.6504
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient	136.9019
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence	120.9168
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience	163.2700
they were making nearly ten knots an hour	1005.6340
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	192.0928
well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you morrel <unk> i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid	101.9056
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune	144.8283
this is a boy trville a mere boy	494.9807
i dont comprehend you dont comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me which of my friends my lord your three friendsthe friends of former days of former days my lord	88.0843
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter	43.1487
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the <unk> my lord	423.6440
we were but the instruments that is all but as to free will aramis how acts the judge	364.4024
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph	242.3559
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	1857.6698
doctor davrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall	893.5176
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan	54.4569
i have warned you	53.1044
it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive	310.3449
the brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	452.8356
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign	130.2006
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the <unk> five minutes after it was down and we sailed under <unk> topsails and top gallant sails	314.9590
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband	116.2431
but how do you know all this how do i know it yes how do you know it	24.4802
the carriage passed under two arched <unk> and at length stopped in a court large dark and square	381.7144
sometimes he <unk> bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore <unk> stones in the water and when the flint makes <unk> and drake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another <unk> or <unk>	501.0019
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	319.1080
no madame the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes	645.8490
well bazin said dartagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	54.4554
what a wrist you have reverend sir said caderousse <unk> his arm all <unk> by the <unk> pincers which had held it what a wrist silence	1852.5410
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have	187.4354
the white flag morbleu we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the <unk> and bore off the flag but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures sake	273.8253
he promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is striking	240.2036
dartagnans plan was very simple	73.1918
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale	83.3438
<unk> chapter 37 the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment	358.8741
faith ive half a mind to do it	543.4595
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos i shall go and shoot on his estate	207.6448
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england	100.4459
a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> fig trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict	289.1280
the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela whom he adored	201.1441
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre	511.8077
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency giovanni obeyed	763.0000
selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your <unk> is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to <unk> troops were firing from underneath	511.5415
by degrees milady became more <unk>	2036.0525
m the epistle is laconic said dartagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the <unk> of the letter	192.1897
the enemy cried the king	79.9166
lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes chamber	57.1491
1e8	15.2602
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham london the letter shall be given to himself generous girl cried anne of austria	92.4712
bonacieux had not been <unk>	449.5584
wasnt i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt	275.6479
and aramis said the duchess quickly	95.3363
and then our gascon with that large quantity of <unk> which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself	728.0056
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de contis lieutenant	86.9180
that is all very simple you had business in england monseigneur said dartagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or <unk> concerns nobody	292.7911
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of <unk> undertakings	521.5937
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of <unk>	1061.0942
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and <unk> like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead	74.9337
wait said athos	17.9632
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine	67.6540
at the turning of the <unk> they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion	159.5925
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her	65.6066
i like to hear you speak thus and i <unk> well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl	419.6194
never <unk> the meantime he <unk> <unk> lovely <unk> least he returns to do that during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousses words fell like molten lead	143.0127
you are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friends then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes	50.5672
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key	77.6497
you were too young to know about such things i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about it and who told you about it asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience	74.7711
well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no m andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind	194.3994
when m andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question the carriage stopped	87.9664
he was called count he was said to possess 50000 livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme	240.0622
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his <unk> hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurators wife	380.9358
you have credit with your landlord then asked porthos	331.4346
no i have good luck that is all	72.4356
non inutile desiderium oblatione go to the devil with your latin	302.3575
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before	182.2961
morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen	216.8876
with whom are you going to fight with beauchamp one of your friends of course it is always with friends that one fights i suppose you have some cause of quarrel i have <unk> what has he done to you there appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for yourself and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance	70.5927
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly	736.3679
let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constables sword gilt for me and for me put in porthos	335.6783
the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the <unk> of a terrible and mysterious irony	62.1114
m dpinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel <unk> however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself <unk> his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort	125.1161
hold	56.1275
oh	13.9358
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	882.9023
behind dartagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak	57.9729
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	547.5753
from what he has told me i know you now	34.0073
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds	541.1876
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep	727.8143
you may be overheard yes you are right i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness but what do you require of me then	122.6509
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthoss horse and that of dartagnan	281.9788
it was situated in a very private spot	98.5420
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard monseigneur said m de trville that will be unjust to the guardsmen	109.6878
do you not father yes resolutely replied noirtier	693.4813
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	115.1484
do you wish for any further details	46.2009
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man	121.3992
dartagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for	343.1916

he cannot acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it fifty thousand francs for being your father	215.2144
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons	273.1098

mousqueton exclaimed dartagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys carriage it is he cried porthos	91.1125

of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg name associated with the work	39.7069
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	975.7570
athos muttered dartagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman	109.9605
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal	88.3601
this was evidently an ambuscade	125.9528
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any <unk>	508.4804
when do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to caderousse	84.8172
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way	914.0585
and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight	225.5889
dear grandpapa cried she what has happened	51.5670
i did replied the count	43.3815
his excellency does not receive visitors today then here is my masters card the baron danglars	933.8198
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them	132.1788
athos said the musketeer	29.6119
to questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given	456.7849
where for for la rochelle he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	459.2824
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands	141.2267
why did you leave the closet monsieur dartagnan asked the cardinal	64.7773
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	249.0200
dartagnan <unk> on a plan	947.8321
if you have two coats you will give me one of them	120.9282
i heard the chevalier dherblay say so the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures	219.6754
oh my dear friend if this be the <unk> you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are <unk> not complain count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arms of a friend	353.7625
to <unk> in champagne i answered	389.9598
i am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so	842.6769
how do you mean said valentine looking anxiously around	59.5981
you dont love me	52.2605
it wants ten minutes to nine said he	191.2260
these were pistols of an especial pattern which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room	801.5477
dartagnan of the kings guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight oclock	203.2794
is our little neighbor worse asked dartagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth	192.9145
athos threw a piece of money to the <unk> to withdraw	338.1107
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you	138.5441
and monsieur dartagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur dherblay may i ask if you have any news of him we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us no sir i am sure he hasnt yet arrived	72.9689
you must make some <unk> in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh	204.3227
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name	97.6771
he is gone	48.3641
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte <unk> here is the priests certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment	563.5365
speak speak take this letter said dartagnan	87.2974
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and <unk>	100.5041
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place	119.8645
did you send this wine aramis said athos	98.2197
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused <unk> but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror	755.7318
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced	322.4238
what	94.0024
you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy	69.5148
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	71.8546
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the counts manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum	120.5564
you will find him quite enthusiastic upon what subject asked madame danglars	133.1604
it was at this moment dartagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them	25.3031
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	369.9727
if i once went up those stairs	1113.0319
does he often go to auteuil added he	149.2103
porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as himself	132.6821
sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt by whom by bonaparte or at least by his adherents my dear blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security wait my dear sir wait a moment for i have such a delightful note on the <unk> <unk> <unk> and i will listen to you afterwards there was a brief pause during which louis xviii	151.8901
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of <unk> damned whose neck <unk> has <unk> and who are ever looking at their heels	600.9800
he has he is an abb ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	261.3320
i became very pale i felt my legs fail me i sought for a reply but could find <unk> was silent	425.8238
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired	96.1308
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder	531.1049
dartagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet	599.3544
firstly at a given signal which shall be the words at last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you	407.4498
there there midnight sounds	235.3344
well then madame yes i did feel fear and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i cannot count how many charges and <unk> i own for the third time in my life i was afraid	971.1754
he shall not come in before i am gone said he and when i am gone you can open to him but i ought to be gone too	86.1271
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarins than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right	509.5229
we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay go go exclaimed dants	195.8243
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses	119.4974
yes it is so long ago answered porthos	71.9157
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket	349.8158
<unk> dants had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	517.1668
he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice	237.5894
i have it with me the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the <unk> of the treasure	689.1488
she became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a console which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syllable	1097.4769
no said she withdrawing it <unk> my friend touch me not	361.0349
m	51.1057
let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts and then your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again i understand said the duke	115.8337
just so	22.4262
be satisfied replied felton he will not sail milady started with joy	252.1259
miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a second	169.1591
have the fugitives been pursued yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted how many are there four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded four said dartagnan looking at porthos	317.4743
let us leave them she said	37.7311
tomorrow morning dartagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him	50.0845
the little apartment was charming for its taste and <unk> but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to miladys chamber	173.6851
why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural that having a house to purchase you purchase it exactly at auteuil and that purchasing it at auteuil this house should be no	55.2783
no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne and shall we arrive there safe and sound as true as my names jack butler well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named	70.7822
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abb busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript yes yes repeated the major <unk> in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe me the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	134.3852
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color	463.3197
arrived at this last hue it changed no more	828.8549
andrea cavalcanti or rather m benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family	77.4544
yes my lord replied the servant m	35.4933
when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my <unk> thrice for my <unk> i do not waste a minute or a word	1054.6711
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	49.1576
<unk> are declining	82.1862
well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now i did you have told me as yet but one of <unk> me hear the other it was <unk> while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and <unk> misfortune	81.0313
oh leave me sir you are tempting meyou make me doubt the goodness of <unk> is impossible it cannot be are you the first that this hand has stricken	453.3407
m dartagnan my dear m dartagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything i will answer for nothing	92.0380
everything was as we have said a question of <unk> to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his <unk> should cease to flow	128.5401
ordinarily m de villefort made and returned very few visits	325.7431
i depend on you	42.9996
she opened and found the word secret ah	481.2938
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke	70.5845
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile	741.3150
well then <unk> for me there and i will soon join you you leave me then yes i also have a pious visit to pay morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city	137.4212
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by dartagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over	107.4748
pardieu gentlemen said he	25.5418
but you continued m bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days	67.1051
you are the kings servant and must go wherever that service calls you oh villefort cried rene clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair <unk> sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet rene i promise to show all the <unk> in my power but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off rene shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head	317.1031
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night	120.6337
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel	32.6910
come said dartagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey where are we to go asked porthos	388.5287

grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything	169.2495
luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest	59.7515
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is <unk> i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands oh pray name it i am wholly a stranger to <unk> is a city i have never yet seen is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world	563.5366
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth the white lips no longer <unk> eyes were suffused with a <unk> vapor and the long black <unk> rested on a cheek white as wax	818.8200
i think nothing i quote a fact that is all	307.9495
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth	95.5819
he had borne with the public prison and with <unk> of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry	893.7537
the chancellor made a profound reverence	2104.2478
there was no time to lose	9.4331
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself adieu gentlemen said de comminges sleep well we will try de comminges went away dartagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted	1170.2407
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	700.7991
you would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to paris oh my god	91.7401
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him tete a tete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade	30.6099
sometimes on a sunday i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my <unk> in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which i am really in want of but nothing happens	195.2393
how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know because in truth albert you hesitate yesi fear you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you	91.8971
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen <unk>	2361.5100
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him	159.7467
ah it is you peppino said the count	40.5365
charles smiled	1118.7797
as to dartagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again return immediately to <unk>	53.0979
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him	36.5362
he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later louis xiv	132.0302
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at <unk> let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	325.2994
take the republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battle field and i promise you 500000 soldiers another <unk> and a second <unk>	210.3857
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and <unk> from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon	1719.6643
can he be afraid of this boy but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and retired	422.3207
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter	55.8497
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but a man royalty is the gift of god	262.1695
bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence	50.5164
heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire dartagnan who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience was beginning to attack the quick	963.6494
<unk> maximilian smiled	2426.2976
creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors	1294.0382
the monks had no longer an instant of repose	119.8142
athos went down to pay the reckoning while dartagnan and planchet stood at the street door	89.8516
from that glass door the pale faced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a <unk> hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard	500.7485
oh my god my god and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming	195.1407
then according to foreign custom the <unk> took place	264.2496
the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine	102.7679
sire go leave france to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of <unk> <unk> <unk> tell him this grard or rather tell him nothing	440.3877
what are you going to do cried mme	17.4007
you will put yourself at the head of the first	18.0011
fourteen years repeated the count	27.0774
and i know i shall drown before reaching it continued blaisois	572.8925
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew	364.1023
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is	373.8581
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed imperceptibly	89.4249
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening	131.9373
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	104.4731
you were not of the party m de morcerf what prince asked albert	111.5534
three blows were struck upon the panel of the door	86.7643
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat	133.3919
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	285.0896
the two brigands looked at each other for a <unk> one with a smile of <unk> on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow	152.3760
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another	395.0774
as the shadows of night <unk> the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive <unk>	760.0934
in <unk> me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	1037.8511
ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca	243.7735
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos	92.6798
it was evident he had his orders	45.1108
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white <unk> in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin	657.1158
a few seconds afterward dartagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword	151.9633
yes why because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to <unk> neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is <unk> in the vessels bottom and then they leave her	441.6411
listen he said today is the 5th of september is it not yes today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay yes we know that well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house what will happen then why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a bankrupt oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	90.3306
what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen	99.7846
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left <unk>	110.7224
valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise	199.8903
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	170.0346
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer	56.0815
ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho	341.2528
what is the matter asked milady	11.5267
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder	100.8956
for heavens sake dont be obstinate for when others are obstinate i am obstinate likewise and then i become ferocious and headstrong and theres my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself	824.2636
some of that at the bottom near the <unk>	644.1956
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow	665.2599

i was blind athos has made me see thats all come here the two friends went near him	162.5555
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing	48.6781
oh then you were glad to hear that m morrel i didnt dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor	109.3144
chapter lvii	110.0461

the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he <unk> his chibouque see all paris pass before him you have no idea then morrel asked chteau renaud you do not propose anything oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the <unk> style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay you have a sister asked the count	870.7196
he had a deep set penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast	615.0619
<unk> or nero those treasure seekers those <unk> of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for	317.8999
and you obeyed father that woman was a monster	283.3908
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants	414.1092
is the committee willing to hear this <unk> yes they all said at once	605.8907
<unk> yes indeed sir continued eugnie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	412.4975
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again	439.0513
i hold this serpent in my hands	322.3705
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought	575.9026
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii	100.7315

the cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in italy	218.4271
the conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet	340.3613
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abb dherblay and in spite of bazins assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion	336.8389
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not	28.9572
now i belong to this last named class and certainly my prospects of military <unk> are most encouraging as well as certain	1320.5083
if thats the case said mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment do you call that nourishment said blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table	478.8688
1f1	26.9636
no	59.9379
upon hearing dartagnans reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him	394.3159
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty	656.5652
well well cried dartagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos yes said porthos but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep i think it is the wind now climb up athos quickly said dartagnan	316.4689
richelieu slowly tore the paper which dartagnan had generously relinquished	74.9066
at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your <unk> robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	129.8500
i who was looking on an eager and curious <unk> who was watching the working of this mournful <unk> who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose <unk> course i was watching and bitten to the heart morrel groaned	826.9395
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these <unk> assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	151.4921
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly <unk> to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you i shall take better care of them myself answered dartagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple <unk> that they will not attempt escape	111.1019
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it tell me replied faria what has <unk> you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dants	544.0252
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter	270.5040
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you <unk> is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached	132.5049
oh yes yes be assured i shall save you	67.9445
he had been obliged to <unk> himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of <unk> presented to him for the purpose of obtaining <unk> of admission to the court on the day of trial	303.6923
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages	2.9913
he was very successful upon that question	216.6630
the valet de chambre announced m de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china	43.2483
a lover is never terrible he said	275.8282
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m dessessart and the company of musketeers of m de trville who had been accustomed to associate together	155.6273
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	180.1199
but mazarin is a low born rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an <unk>	750.9978
28 no	569.8943
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m davrigny no mercy sir	119.7306
villefort burst it open with a violent blow	383.2314
the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited	404.8743
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency	990.0818
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his <unk> by whose side he might weep	268.4746
give me your arm and let us go very well let us go said caderousse but i dont want your arm at all	20.0647
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest <unk> but what have i done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you	112.0962
dartagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	147.5061
you are included in the conscription fernand and are only at liberty on <unk> liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms	1319.9076
it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and <unk> the ineffectual light of the lamp	303.1604

oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here <unk> the whole of the 500000 livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never <unk> is a <unk> where he wins without playing and is no <unk> when he loses the baroness became enraged	563.5895
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of dartagnan	59.3731
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the acadmie des <unk> et <unk> <unk> if we should not <unk> very probable thing by the <unk> gaining admission to the acadmie <unk> with our own proper pack	615.5883

a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared	132.0008
listen said m de trville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend you will do me honor monsieur said dartagnan	92.5313
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something <unk> and irresolute	102.9537
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her	228.0936
dartagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds	745.1688
as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name	408.5636
is it about sending me to the bastile	202.5655
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project	129.2006
he had not done so for ten years before	32.2249
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him	66.0209
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa	50.5180
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions	83.7962
command	26.0149
<unk> let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee	89.6384
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute	555.3178
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step	244.4706
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperors intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the <unk> <unk> friend said my mother when your masters orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of <unk> us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will <unk> kill us with this same poniard will you <unk> vasiliki replied selim tranquilly	290.5653
millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in france alas said de winter i am at this moment as poor as he is if not <unk>	77.3021
noirtier	38.5879
at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult	122.9044
now if you have them andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket	76.4082
but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700000 francs per month	333.8938
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it	682.5124
be calm exclaimed athos for heavens sake	312.4164
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the <unk> of the <unk>	101.5644
the procurator repeated several times ah madame coquenard	548.5425
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her <unk> year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance	105.1628
we dont want either rope ladders or gag <unk> now my lord said athos do not let us disturb you	1117.3765
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman however that may be dartagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his <unk> love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	740.3909
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz	85.6941
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son in law excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you m noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains it	113.9483
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone	91.4741
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away who told you that my dear asked milady	91.0962
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest	242.0710
on my honor they are not poisoned	96.6762
and blood too	1994.6791
mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him	46.8676
i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy count you prolong my agony then said the count your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request	79.1675
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	107.7526
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning	760.9849
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs	538.2979
that would carry you to the end of the world	24.2050
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo	244.4649
i mean spinach replied aramis but on your account i will add some eggs and that is a serious <unk> of the <unk> eggs are meat since they <unk> <unk> this feast is not very <unk> but never mind i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you i am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis but if your body be not greatly benefited by it be assured your soul will and so aramis you are decidedly going into the church	742.6630
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the <unk>	148.4250
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	612.5860
the king has nothing like it no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin	162.1333
you cannot think of going out in such weather as this oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller	137.6490
dants in his cell heard the noise of <unk> that at the depth where he lay would have been <unk> to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	407.6595
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare	921.3795
he was quite alone on one side was the vast <unk> of the saint lazare on the other paris <unk> in darkness	543.9209
saddle our horses take your carbine whom are we going to attack sir no one a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon	237.1322
ah	42.7777
it seemed to him as though he were in a <unk> and was becoming as mad as those he saw	112.8216
absolution tell me her name and i will give it her name <unk> god have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die	131.3874
he turned a <unk> toward the little group amongst which the king stood	783.3906
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though ive been here a week has not ordered so much as a <unk> but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good my pastry not good	306.9471
what do you think of the plan gentlemen admirable replied the young men in chorus	136.5359
he repaired then instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel	68.7079
de chavigny who according to report was a son of <unk> and had been a creature of the late cardinals understood tyranny	148.4999
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary i said the queen	642.8313
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of <unk>	124.8247
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of <unk> heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	897.5240
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m bonacieux accosted him	36.8811
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such <unk> pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested <unk> injury is repugnant to every mind	1646.2256
you understand my dear girl continued dartagnan she is the wife of that frightful <unk> you saw at the door as you came in oh my god	119.3788
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met m de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing room	50.8385
my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you deep grief was depicted on morrels features he seized monte cristos hand	416.6695
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be <unk> and <unk> your thesis	892.9115
madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the <unk> she was also one of the greatest beauties at court	137.8052
but that must be a princess at <unk> lady with her negro boy and her maid my god	1478.2842
dartagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	465.8396
as he was passing the alle des <unk> he thought he saw the counts horses standing at <unk> shooting gallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman	787.6624
well is all said all then lets count our money and divide it	1226.7902
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all what brother cried milady must i name him again	157.9097
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way and you will pay ready money <unk> and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank notes which might have been twice the sum m de boville feared to lose	120.2322
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dants as <unk> as he had ascended he <unk> leaped from the table to the ground	105.7378
then i speak at random instead of <unk> about the <unk> of hell i talk of the joys of paradise	824.5876
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head	32.2257
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now	100.8526
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de trville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it his threat completed the <unk> of the host	24.2688
you have to do with that woman	25.5048
he has two means of extricating me from this <unk> one by a mysterious escape managed through <unk> the other by buying off my judges with gold	2377.7605
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed	97.7963
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	33.5426
ah	58.9979
the young man remained immovable	13.3336
dants was almost glad of this <unk> and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what <unk> he could bear suffering	2017.3652
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine	132.2960
what diabolical <unk> you have performed here said porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone	257.0745
you would have done what i did mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength	116.3434
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing boats with their white sails were alone visible	103.5956
it is not here <unk> and then he moved farther on and began again to dig	637.9078
dartagnan pressing his hand repeated his call	538.3207
he must be apprehended do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	344.0341
a hundred pistoles said dartagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as job	69.8417
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them	275.1774
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the <unk> had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	324.4908
by no means	36.1817
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world you live alone then i do you have no <unk> sonno father i have no one how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life it is not my fault madame	118.1934
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	38.3989
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door	54.9549
he recognized the place where he had <unk> by the bed of <unk> that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto	148.4449
at the noise made by dartagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world	91.4695
the cart was returning empty to paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to <unk> the wagoners thirst along the route	1224.9359
well yes pretty well replied dartagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere yes that is inevitable said porthos	114.7329
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued	892.9451
i am a sailor not a second was to be lost	63.6667
shall two members of the house be sent to yanina	195.6986
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast <unk> of people	181.0180
villefort placed the arm of madame de saint mran within his own and conducted her to his apartment	45.0077
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him yes yes cried both young men	55.2985
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm	369.8292
ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief	138.0072
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign	388.5687
athos made no reply	15.2498
you wish to ask for liberty andi give it you oh my lord answered dartagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you you have your liberty repeated mazarin in terror	65.0724
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have <unk> him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that <unk> manner the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most <unk> father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics	64.8213
<unk> see here exclaimed caderousse	708.5861
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend king charles we have but ill defended himit remains for us to save him to save the king said dartagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos	203.9929
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you	243.9212
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token	179.7085
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done dartagnan but perhaps you have been wrong dartagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	49.4189
then you know him almost screamed the countess	194.1779
take this peach then she said	645.6165
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary	55.0960
then your excellency is going to the hotel <unk> pastrini said the cicerone to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on	224.6617
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn yes monseigneur	35.8700
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt m de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home	43.3654
peste thats a fine age replied porthos	182.2476
why should that man give me a false diamond <unk> to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea	450.2389
madame de saint mran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	246.6818
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer	306.9645
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother	71.3425
he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage	930.2488
now there remains the chevalier or the abb dherblay as your majesty pleases does he wish to be a bishop no madame something easier to grant what it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville the queen smiled	92.3478
the other room near the library was a bedroom	608.9810
at the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	360.4164
then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees	383.1431
what do you say to it aramis why the idea of taking quarters with <unk> <unk> seems to me very reasonable and for my part i agree to it	939.3608
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else	171.8381
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and <unk>	80.5443
you ought i say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman	332.0471
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her <unk> were of jewels	358.3587
that <unk> is divine he exclaimed	1073.7670
god of goodness	837.6640

ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet we went out	152.2787
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else	115.4197
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over	215.3388
chapter lxi	135.6576
so thought the gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who doesnt at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex	739.6791
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	107.3158
are you not a christian he said falling on his knees	46.3603
i waited your orders said dartagnan crossing swords	391.3177
but our troop horses said aramis	1366.9117
going along dartagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not	275.1749
dartagnan ran out and returned directly after	326.0192

athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the half curtains closely drawn	167.9045
but all my fortune is in england	73.9696
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of dartagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late dartagnan had already recognized mme	103.5929
i am <unk> not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business	244.4391

she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great <unk> in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives	1386.2445
our dear count said dartagnan	32.1770
ay that <unk> good	200.4978
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april 1625 the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the <unk> of the jolly miller	430.5784
dartagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen	275.1622

it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered	70.6179
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you	72.0198
yes shall i call him yes valentine went to the door and called barrois	77.7700

duke you already know that it is not i who caused you to be written to yes yes madame	69.6116

but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their <unk> <unk>	157.8063
but dartagnan had reckoned without the wind	147.1638
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	763.4283
oh yes yes this instant i entreat you in a moment that part of the floor on which dants was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back <unk> while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	86.2615
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	180.5850
why does not he go about his business stupid fellow yourself said dartagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window	265.5722

madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon	296.4154
i like everyone and you include me in the expression <unk> thanks let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few	533.4371
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coach houses where the <unk> <unk> and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with <unk> to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters	1384.8234
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercds and his father whereas he was now confined in the chteau dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercds and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise	652.1190
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was <unk> over this answer which did not seem very clear	62.5655

he converted his chamber into an observatory	97.2042
this was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto	49.3169
thanks to the influence of m morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed	153.1626
what are you about asked dartagnan	21.2236
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	288.2569
what would you do i should give up broussel said porthos	29.3422
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars	126.2568
ah yes we burn as they say at the game of <unk>	268.2569
no madame replied monte cristo but you see i make no resistance we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove the count looked at mercds as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking	52.4763

and i really dont know what prevents me from exterminating you all alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see	657.7653
fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercds	243.8362
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	206.8785
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service	50.0066
there now shall we start when you like but have you no groom no that idiot bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore cannot leave notre dame	389.6277

it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passers by repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on one side like the masks of the ancients	565.7207

now as dartagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his	173.3539

this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow	993.5901

in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his <unk> had been to henry iii and his scotch guard to louis xi	699.8501
but dants was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybodys <unk> of friendship	1090.1724
there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the <unk> in exchange all the visions of the soul	223.1136

the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously	140.8676
for my own part i have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether <unk> his political principles	132.2944
fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat	183.8739
ah if you could but help <unk> we could both together defeat their plan	1107.0921
what must i do above all things be always on your guard	89.5329
i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do cried dartagnan	232.0417
at length they arrived at the cemetery	18.7001
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages	100.4146
tis true	31.8519
although dartagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercers pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart	141.8337
dartagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight	260.4274
i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens aramis will follow us by that of noyon as to dartagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchets clothes while planchet will follow us like dartagnan in the uniform of the guards gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair	102.4019
a candle of coarse <unk> on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful <unk> far less calm	478.3261
bonacieux what is it it is the uniform of the cardinals guards	23.8104
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars	71.0882
yet this catalan has eyes that <unk> like those of the <unk> spaniards <unk> and <unk> and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow	959.5338
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake	675.1447
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives but what is that to me provided i see you again	54.7142
they may hear us i dont understand it at all as you execute you will understand and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise ah that is true hush porthos remained silent and motionless	128.9547
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation	72.3301
do you think of him yes madame often and often but <unk> as we say in italy next after monsieur de cond comes the duke of orleans what are you saying	467.3692
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged	164.2422
you would then be in present possession of the letter	94.5201
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion	16.6396
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the <unk>	210.0518
however for my part i would rather die <unk> than have anything to say to such a confessor	135.3089
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is <unk> is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank	40.9729
but as lord wilmore in the character of the counts enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english	156.2896
were you present during the last struggle asked m davrigny	212.8894
pass on replied the guard	215.7842
without that what would become of me it was one oclock in the morning	29.0782
but will you not go up pass on before me i beg of you as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	79.6121
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased	77.7272
as to dartagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying	297.1448
see this gentleman out said the count to bertuccio	111.9141
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me	95.5290
if paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be <unk>	1675.1689
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy	179.0402
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussels release	79.9611
today is the twentieth of september	328.9179
has she then been appointed provost of merchants no but she has become queen of paris <unk> interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the palais royal or the tuileries she is installed at the hotel de ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke you didnt tell me of that aramis really	2145.2725
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture really this is frightful stop a minute you dont know all yet	278.7927
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majestys pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur dartagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said dartagnan bowing	127.7813
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty anne hesitated	118.2638
you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body	35.4153
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part	368.4651
dants waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen	361.0835
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself	1174.0890
at one of the doors that by which he had entered i placed our scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again	62.9041
that <unk> me a little has he wit or <unk> demon dartagnan said porthos astonished at his friends deception	1932.8807
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	25.9613
dartagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de trville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens	66.4728
though i remember in our affair of the rue frou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos said aramis	83.6457
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered	247.1358
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	81.6182
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated	371.3956
an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march	290.3846
how dartagnan and porthos earned by selling straw	25.2296
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping	604.2646
impossible	95.4145
this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or <unk> but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is but how could you have these fish brought to france oh nothing more easy	1413.9700
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	92.4911
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform	188.6657
m danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end am i indeed so happy said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow	325.3741
your pardon sir said milady with mildness	386.2489
no no	14.1022
dartagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	49.2367
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope youre preparing a pretty trial why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume i should think not indeed	871.5428
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me	607.7284
we shall wait for you dartagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him	45.9132
adieu	90.4769
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	1817.1011
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	183.5618
we have had a narrow escape but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son	629.0124
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	61.7663
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression	713.9164
this immediately recalled to dartagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme	131.4368
you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow	334.1085
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina	75.4548
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you	125.7293
you may call on the notary m deschamps place <unk> faubourg saint honor and you have my authority to <unk> those deeds sir replied m dpinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband indeed i fear <unk> valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmothers last <unk> there will be no obstacle from that quarter i assure you in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please i have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it then said villefort nothing further is required	768.7285
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered	160.9205
franz found himself in utter darkness	43.7843
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didnt see what that had to do with him	224.5731
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	649.3958

one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	170.0387
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank	442.9576
besides you forget csar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a <unk> or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two csar gave way before such <unk> reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner	701.1952
paternal affection	2.0840
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the <unk> and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance <unk> me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or <unk> but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her <unk> gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of <unk> and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the <unk> of morcerfs remark	1287.9329
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from barn have not fallen like so many <unk> upon poor bernajoux and have not <unk> him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead	287.2521
he was a brave and an honest man and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars	184.1490
thank god	20.4096
when you leave this you will behold my men at work	143.0351
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort	143.5650
she had still her nymph like form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with anne of austria over the moat of the tuileries in <unk> in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family	637.0876
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three steps forward	201.6171
dartagnan started	169.1736
oh cried porthos do you think so you are exaggerating athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant	138.1178
ali appeared	189.6538
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief	648.1104
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible	469.6201
dartagnan followed but less <unk> showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed	690.0646
an instant after they were on the deck	20.3846
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house	117.6777
as i rode by the counts house i perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain	82.8806
never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the <unk>	607.5016
they searched they questioned	2279.9934

go on said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end evening came the ordinary events took place	84.7294
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment	189.3170
grimaud drew out a pistol	38.2866
but all this will come to an end trville will come to an end	64.0913
save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself	67.0300
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the htel de ville for this important evening	47.0051

i have only two <unk> will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even <unk> are time and distance	1156.9417
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	294.5133
indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the <unk> of their carbines against my breast	428.5072

has anything particular happened in the neighborhood	716.8013
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he <unk> them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder	193.9309
count returned signor pastrini hurt at alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns	856.2277
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer	32.9319
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert and the steamboat she is at chlons yes the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels very good when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road your excellency may depend upon me the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was <unk> along swiftly to the bankers house	67.9686

no but we are going to replied dartagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground	72.1580
he started when he saw rene for he fancied she was again about to plead for dants	201.9305

can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished	79.3744
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honor	22.4190
you understand athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger	506.2081
oh what imprudence my lord said dartagnan tis not good to be about just here without a light	204.2586
the escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait	59.3654
it was a terrible moment for the young man	13.6307
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	555.5255
<unk> as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction <unk> his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	586.9026
stop let me show you the way it is not worthwhile yes it is why because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of <unk> <unk> locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist thank you said andrea i will let you know a week beforehand they parted	43.0469
ah traitor muttered dartagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix	369.7805
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet then he carried hayde to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will	465.7092
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no	207.2920

in fact i am dead	71.5162
this morning i awoke at six oclock	100.8148
each retired to his own apartment	62.5956
i have extricated you from misery felton i have caused you to be named lieutenant i once saved your life you know on what occasion	385.1594
i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert	162.8337
davrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abb promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier	101.3457
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman <unk> with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding	182.3900
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100000 francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the <unk> of the angel i spoke of just now this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing	121.7070
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it dartagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you	44.7675
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres	34.3963
however in an hour i shall know all	39.2175

this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron <unk> beasts who will pick us off like <unk> in this place	928.0150
outside this door a spade was placed against the wall i took it and advanced towards the thicket	58.1770
well did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward	1511.0154
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary there has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise	172.1151
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantsthe latter of whom attracted universal notice	204.4495
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athoss chamber and that of the park	83.7113
four <unk> came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in <unk> of the compliment lowered her own <unk> into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two oclock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amlie and on terra firma	29.0556
so i will not abandon this bouquet pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the <unk> the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole	879.7215
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower beds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her <unk> and her <unk> in her porcelain <unk> with more pains than this hitherto <unk> gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure	521.7621

doctor doctor cried barrois who felt another fit coming	423.9862
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them	104.9748
without <unk> his secret dants could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	932.3342
it is well sir replied villefort from <unk> is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side	255.6077
true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia	498.5081
all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur dartagnan is doubtless true said the queen but i have confidence in you alone	58.7459
we will try and carry him on board the tartan dants declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him	117.2538
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal	69.2674
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him	558.4150

hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before broussels door	57.0702
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber	202.1021
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another	146.2251
the name of your ship inquired dartagnan	185.3960
an excellent idea	104.1434
the count opened the letter and read m	32.8303
