morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word	92.5526
but all these reasons were combated destroyed <unk> by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood <unk> that some great misfortune is hanging over us	502.3980

franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage	386.4759
let us understand each other my lord replied dartagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake	42.0057
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of <unk> jove predicted a storm	272.6763
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed	1245.6305
it is only shown to me to terrify me thats all you are mistaken	89.7323

remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man young man said richelieu if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i have said to you today i promise you to do so this last expression of <unk> conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed dartagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning	450.5851
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard	26.7365
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding <unk>	800.2160
this letter had been conveyed by dartagnan and had arrived in time	52.5393
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at <unk> is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble	67.9908
you are <unk> much the better	1109.0383
come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart what exclaimed porthos without supper	215.9228
at them echoed de guiche	590.5310
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality	215.1353

chapter 13 the hundred days m noirtier was a true prophet and things <unk> rapidly as he had predicted	663.0911
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his body	289.9520
porthos was discontented with his condition	24.0991
at last dartagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and dartagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	629.4901
dartagnan went to the window with his habitual composure	65.5809
you cannot be mistaken there is but one afterward you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word forward which means in french en avant	76.2865
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric	925.6064
ah	74.1436
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de <unk> and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	621.7352
oh if so punish me as you will but do <unk> not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained hayde replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free free to do what asked the young girl	589.4528

he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of	237.0762
every one arose	49.0980
he saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in <unk> drawing a sword and firing a <unk> something haughty and contemptuous in his face	667.3557

when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any <unk> schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the <unk> of these possibilities the terrible <unk> of the <unk> that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m dpinay into personal contact	178.6550

besides as m de trville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress	87.8296
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted	221.3118
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds	186.1333
so he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs	236.2786
oh yes tired <unk> has done nothing the whole of this blessed day	1690.0925
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them	137.6974
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray	205.9066
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the <unk> of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said dartagnan	183.6852
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom	212.0899
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint mran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	33.4031
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass and here is a book which contains the <unk> at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words your mass at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer	177.9304
yes but never with the same advantages said dartagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight very good very good said the voice	64.6791
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud	327.0347

porthos seeing this <unk> his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great <unk> she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	529.3283
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing room	325.4557
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its <unk> clock gave its warning to strike <unk> door of his study opened	2424.2183
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come <unk> you think then all is not over yet said albert horror stricken	330.2274

chapter 12 father and son m <unk> it was indeed he who <unk> after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	728.6824
quick said a voice at the end of the gallery	23.1091
those who are known are not the most dangerous i know it and appeal to your penetration	215.3347
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law	283.5186
to the questions which dartagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad then replied he my visit is ill <unk> you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will withdraw no no said milady	1005.5870

m de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	43.4849
as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master	149.3238
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a <unk> and dants guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were <unk> the boat	474.2846

in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow	202.6705
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing <unk> and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome	1122.6284
eventually she was obliged to leave france	82.4148
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage	37.7597
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	44.5937
have no more concern about me i exist no longer for you any more than if you had never seen me must aramis do as much as i madame said dartagnan deeply piqued	121.6890
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room	288.2509
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly	362.7203
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be <unk> enough i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a <unk> which promises something yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required	161.4517
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	187.9526
quick quick	276.1208
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass	113.9214
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	62.2545
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard these announced the arrival of the queen	79.0445
we discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going to day to learn something else you really have some distrust then said porthos	130.8028

the apartment destined for the purpose was <unk> and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some <unk> reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house	191.7319

for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman <unk> even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword	145.9521
the park is twenty <unk> <unk> kitchen gardens and a common	927.6591
he went to desire you to come to the palace	79.5071

as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets	130.0231
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders	507.3293
i have the honor to be with respect etc marechal de grammont at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i loved his friend	1126.3147

on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully	336.5320
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	58.6907
dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young mans brow and his teeth chattered	32.8683

now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	121.9894

and as to this book added she pointing to the <unk> with her finger but without touching it as if she must be <unk> by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de <unk> accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively	283.4760
how fine it is to be called cond and to be so worthy of such a name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	82.8446

but first of all i must get there he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo	52.3096
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	584.7698
<unk>	44.6721
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos	243.2299
however he remained standing clinging to a window	112.1985
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you <unk> without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done sire replied m de trville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king	154.1733
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	255.8144
she had laid that down the preceding evening	147.9751
silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came but where and when shall i see you again cried dartagnan	56.1059
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck	393.7361
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	25.7898
grimaud came rubbing his half open eyes to answer this noisy summons and dartagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey	722.0217
106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker	382.1527
well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied dartagnan	75.1955
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse	814.7640
with what ideas does that letter inspire you oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that m danglars has left suspiciously certainly but is this all you have to say to me i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness	506.3935
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not i replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte cristo oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it	280.8876
poor edward is as much m noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m franz m noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more	189.3620
you told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser	199.4003
there is a struggle in nature against this divine <unk> nature which is not made for joy and <unk> to pain	531.3073
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the <unk> vibration of the three strokes	2265.3723
cowardly court	610.6366
come louise let us talk of our affairs	125.7261
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor <unk> every vein	38.6253
he began by asking m bonacieux his name age condition and abode	1198.9700
is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	45.5443
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring	286.4656
tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety	81.3841
dont be a coward or i shall cut off your ears	73.9828
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him	203.0759
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abb seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in <unk> hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart	145.0579
you who never interest yourself in politics ah	439.2812
after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth yes said the count yes i raised the stones and found a rope ladder and some tools how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment	147.6386
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandits wrist until his arm being <unk> he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor	1826.5310
and then i also wish to see a notary that i may be assured that all our property returns to valentine ah grandmamma murmured valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me	108.2486
no indeed sir answered raoul	167.8923
have i the honor of addressing the abb busoni asked the visitor	32.1746
i have never been understood and no wonder	238.2657
my dear friends said dartagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners it was not long before they joined the escort	67.7758
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	58.6699
encouraged by this discovery edmond determined to assist the indefatigable <unk>	832.3434
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me no i thank you should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not i am not sure be twenty four hours in prison without getting free my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly	100.3720
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name	485.7859
for mercys sake then what would you call robespierre	663.6555
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience	1453.9991
morrels clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek	1443.4664
promise me that and i will die with that hope i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself did you see all that remember my words if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you also and you did not warn me cried caderousse raising himself on his elbows	70.4866
dartagnan no longer doubted that this was porthoss pleasant dwelling place	2030.1089
dartagnan determined upon his course	680.3289
why buy what one can take take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor	1306.0197
chteau renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin	64.0497
what are you looking at there	29.3876
but you know none are so formal as bankers in <unk> business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds	2240.7251
pardon my frankness too my lord i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence	272.4673
but you my dear dartagnan what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said dartagnan	55.2351
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dants who felt the muzzle against his temple	231.2614
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore	47.3012
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me	55.0155
but dants cannot remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe <unk> him who was the cause of his incarceration oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me yes and mercds	90.0948
i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to trport well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow before <unk> will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure well you can do better	87.6781
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m de saint mran i applied my smelling salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied	134.7818
to me sir said he	21.1419
i should affirm the <unk> and i deny it said trville	697.7295
but dress me as well as you are able only make haste think my dear girl its life and death kitty was but too well aware of that	248.3178
the other members silently dispersed	1149.9267
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	97.4683
i was like you and had a king in keeping aha said groslow what king our own to be sure the little <unk> xiv and how long had you to take care of him three nights and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure how do you mean i mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking <unk> ah true said the englishman with a sigh you frenchmen are born boon companions and dont you play too when you are on guard never said the englishman	327.7283
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides	798.0410
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for <unk> and <unk> a deep seated hatred of <unk> were the elements of private and public life displayed by m de villefort	759.4275
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them	630.5950
but i repeat to you i am charged with <unk> it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how	95.9772
well repeated porthos	390.2877
that might do if we were <unk> with englishmen or germans oh may god keep me from it and you too said dartagnan	579.2115
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you you have said puritans have but one word	83.0372
how	60.3627
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	43.7826
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self this is no <unk> it is all reality in order to believe it	123.8849
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart	746.9888
at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow	525.3162
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said dartagnan	29.7974
never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night what are we to do then to night to <unk> but sit down dear friend to table	151.6066
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day	438.6242
bring six of them why this man is a cask said the host aside	191.2823
the youth brought a small loaf	1655.0481
well then a good journey to you said caderousse	35.5870
aha cried dartagnan <unk> coming toward us so much the worse for them said porthos	82.5524
dartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment	27.2449
on entering his htel m de trville thought it best to be first in making the complaint	144.2203
on seeing him dartagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	111.8023
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these <unk> very much as the slaves were treated in <unk> minor whose masters made them <unk> doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti	301.9624
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one child	199.3951
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dants might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	132.4240
how much were your animals worth porthos ah if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a <unk> no matter you can tell within ten crowns why <unk> and bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount there will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said dartagnan contentedly	678.1591
dants told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm	133.7747
groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice	497.5326
i was taken to the slave market and was purchased by a rich <unk>	1573.2307
since that time many things have happened to you	39.6887
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them	377.3889
but we must not lose time	33.9761
1e2	79.7422
edmond started	1770.5726
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point	350.0080
i could not ride behind	385.2301
i want to be enlightened on a subject then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw be enlightened said athos <unk>	51.5755
i learn this desire or rather i suspect that you feel it and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing i send one of my officers to meet you i place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which i am governor whither i come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other i have prepared you a chamber	96.7731
well said villefort	22.2244
ah i can understand that	18.5613
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such <unk> that no discovery followed her investigation	174.8475
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a <unk>	90.0862
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep	105.7018
and his name said he	56.4464
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution	602.7211
my sword	346.3673
a ray of joy passed across m de bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at self control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum thats no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act	118.5191
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii	56.0624
made richelieu smile	590.7792
dost know where porthos is <unk> at all and aramis not in the least the devil	198.6699
oh said athos oh no it is impossible	28.0406
taste that fowl and those fish	2188.0715
without doubt he recognized dartagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	120.8878
this young boarder of yours has she tried to fly no that is true but <unk> is another thing i believe she is detained in france by some love affair ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor victim alas yes said milady	532.7759
in a few hours they were in the capital	28.2961
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive <unk> it will be the worse for you	468.1650
monsieur de beaufort or another	45.4894
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by <unk> is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures this indeed is <unk> more it is sublime <unk> albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm	559.3821
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse <unk> officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah	2314.0989
come said he to himself be a man	23.6342
the young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind and monsieur the duc dorleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union	694.3766
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn	86.8511
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought	502.5301
tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mothers sanction	283.7594
i hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should i accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are <unk> our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess	241.9601
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach	123.4613
you do not know these <unk> millionaires they are regular misers	47.2096
but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it	19.2404
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as <unk> asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure	469.9436
how very astonishing cried he at length	389.5447
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable	354.2819
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so stop and aramis gave him a louis dor	83.2227
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray	369.5092
well asked he of the count what has then happened nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced	83.1644
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad	323.0753
most likely replied vampa coolly	642.3527
felton barred his passage	993.5164
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work i tore up several of my shirts and <unk> out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle and when i was removed to the chteau dif i managed to bring the <unk> with me so that i have been able to finish my work here and was it not discovered that your sheets were <unk> oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i <unk> the edges over again with what with this needle said the abb as opening his ragged vestments he showed dants a long sharp fish bone with a small <unk> eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it	391.9711
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn <unk> m noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m franz de quesnel baron dpinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect	1079.4286
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they	244.6010
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers	2088.5176
but my lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far what do you say	85.4145
oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks oh my lord	151.8957
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak very well said dartagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet	201.4840
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently	400.1917
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me	288.1675
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away oh mon dieu	119.4569
it was his <unk> <unk> that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his years the fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him	993.3162
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier	212.4651
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected <unk> of friendship	363.8353
the duc delbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others	2032.8958
ah cried the dying man with all the <unk> of a grief declared after long suppression ah	770.3577
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited	122.9294

parliament indeed cried athos	157.5746
well asked dartagnan	15.0535
he will spoil the feast i will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesnt speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away do you know my friend i find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me my lord the day after to morrow is pentecost well what is pentecost to me	346.0228
do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open particularly in the night	126.8183
thank god you have come eh	139.7733
it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her coming	142.0396

chapter ii	214.7967
confound it	2.9719
oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard	97.2306
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him	241.3199
no kitty you are mistaken	123.2237
as they were going down dartagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader	60.6822
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say dartagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question	72.7582
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would <unk> only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance	303.5216
i am of a frankness of character quite french rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile	227.7299
ive remarked that your puritans <unk> in that color but can you find your man said aramis to athos	415.4731
as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had <unk> the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real <unk> loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle	990.9697
keep your <unk> it i <unk> never has too muchbut at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it it was offered with good will said dants	584.9912

retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind	521.6650
yes returned aramis	408.6254
evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of a mother she watched for his return	307.5444
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey	280.4784
do you not see your friends or are you too proud to speak to them no my dear fellow replied dants i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride ah very well thats an explanation said caderousse	31.1575
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a <unk> so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a <unk> suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten oclock	100.6653
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	283.6256
i as a tender father and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you whom do you mean by they ma foi i can hardly tell but i was <unk> to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not yes from whom from a certain abb busoni have you any knowledge of him no i have never seen him what did he say in the letter you will promise not to betray me rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans hand	307.3933

lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars	635.8273

standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a <unk> which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan	113.9494
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet	60.1428
the queen on her part thus <unk> softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer	494.6178
a servant entered summoned by alberts ring of the bell	640.9012
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration	243.4960
still you must breakfast somewhere but if i am not hungry said the young man	63.9971
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive	145.8821
there is no hurry you know	36.1379
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la <unk> never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her	756.3212

had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot villeforts father laughed	273.4353
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos	39.5957
here i am exclaimed porthos	55.2418
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together	80.5651
he was quite prepared for any such encounter	599.6276
my faith said dartagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you cannot have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay	46.5668
well my lord	12.2178
while i watched the window he guarded the door good said athos	195.0623
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything ma foi you frighten me	382.7157
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de trville is particularly attached to their majesties	40.6817
the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people thats right cried morrel	882.4789
nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows everything in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife perhaps he may but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wifes relations with madame de chevreuse but monseigneur i know nothing about them i have never seen her when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her and how many were there of these linen drapers two monseigneur and where did they live one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de la harpe did you go into these houses with her never monseigneur i waited at the door and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone she gave me none she told me to wait and i waited you are a very <unk> husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal	56.6813
but enough of <unk> is my card take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street	1019.7934
i am afraid that what was first done was <unk> if not worse than useless	1006.0825
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him	92.0624
on perceiving the count he rose quickly	51.7348
morrel said chteau renaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	35.7561
here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond friend caderousse caderousse and his wife again <unk> a meaning look	274.9393
you had nothing left oh yes my friend there was still that diamond left which <unk> on your finger and which i had observed yesterday this diamond said dartagnan placing his hand eagerly on his ring	262.6454
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor	249.4203
athos remained a musketeer under the command of dartagnan till the year <unk> at which period after a journey he made to <unk> he also quit the service under the pretext of having inherited a small property in <unk>	413.9811
i should not have guessed it	71.5833
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgres which was likewise the way to paris	145.0126
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french	366.0583
guard her	299.6305
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police	51.3845
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	68.5140
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same <unk> stupid one i admit but very <unk> you any money something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for <unk> young man must live <unk>	461.8775
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him	336.3893
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	355.0443
it is to be to morrow said aramis hastily	75.8633
i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her	65.5663
but first write your request to dessessart	550.3346
help	42.9091
m de villefort entered his fathers room followed by madame de villefort	15.8884
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything	804.6545
ah	32.9157
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting pistols then at eight oclock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was <unk> with an arrogant <unk> or a supernatural being	83.1805
what is it	5.2657
m de trville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen	138.9145
as regards the <unk> corsinari really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in any way no sir replied monte cristo besides has she not yes sir said the major she has <unk> paid the last debt of nature alas yes returned the italian	1394.2653
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed	95.3660
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling the queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away	395.1533
porthos had discovered the means the diamond	76.0805
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain	194.5383
grimaud rose	745.5829
oh those figures how well i remember them	533.6216
the mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it	119.5428
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	232.9165
that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains	923.2094
yes very well	35.7097
i will lay a wager that twas that saint <unk> porthos who performed this feat	1032.8404
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband	196.5166
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice	98.1631
so much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets i do not reproach you monsieur said dartagnan tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis haughtily	56.9844
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone	23.8074
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said dartagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are <unk> we are said porthos	120.8066
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the <unk> in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject	713.1346
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541 contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by us federal laws and your states laws	23.5648
you see its evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a <unk> take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not	182.5408
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender	171.3377
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace	34.4184
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping	171.5947
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	46.4985
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	274.3029
i live there during my leave of absence continued maximilian and i shall be together with my brother in law emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply	67.1431
mon dieu	1.0005
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other	129.9312
i will do as children do for fear of losing the <unk> the name along the route	734.0951
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room	529.8273
i am replied dants in bad italian a maltese sailor	2487.9739
oh my god my god	5.4469
though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh bicarat wished to hold out but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield	456.7088
you is it	140.0427
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	49.9522
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	120.6613
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess	507.8802
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline <unk> yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and <unk> temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	12.5015
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are and you asked joannes	77.0704
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period	359.9393
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	166.1859
hayde whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all <unk> natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear	934.1039
arrested at compiegne they have been carried to rueil at rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal who has either kept them near him or sent them to saint germain	90.5292
by this smile m de trville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the point	62.5862
come let us speak of your little affairs	48.3014
if so depend on it you will be happy me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me	107.1321
if you know monsieur de trville you must have visited him often said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end	71.0064
laporte place the king in bed laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet	126.6624
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late still i will go	270.9102
say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and <unk> in his moments of ill humor irritated him	274.3908
monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i supplicate you	25.5626
poor madame du vallon	37.6859
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their <unk> <unk> in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant <unk> rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and <unk> the light that gilded its massive <unk> so that the voyagers were in shadow	303.3089
now mazarin was alone and <unk> as he well knew	438.6894
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterdays <unk>	106.6638
he likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	224.3210
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray	233.1407
yes but in my soul much more than in my body we will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of bethune as these people say that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could <unk> is to say i was but am no longer it is fifteen years since i gave up the office	67.7754
well asked the president what is your decision <unk> i have no reply to make said the count in a low tone	77.6680
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day by <unk> rejoined mazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing wooden head that you are there is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out thats my concern i will make him speak ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out pooh	102.1859
he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook	92.4272
chapter xxxix	117.8324
what will monsieur de trville say	38.8187
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side	310.9642
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	87.4733
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and <unk>	193.1368
relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two <unk> <unk>	75.2648
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect who was your brother asked he	103.5663
the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman	272.0051
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees	74.2966
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman was my mother the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard	80.0021
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five thousand	220.6100
the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass	478.3261
us laws alone swamp our small staff	18.9153
dartagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning	140.6394
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	657.8268
to how much said she	138.6316
danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed	963.9201
what is he doing	13.4598
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me how did the viscount albert fall into luigis hands excellency the frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa the chiefs mistress yes	130.7496
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of 4000 roman <unk> 24000 francs	1580.4761
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day	323.7762
the first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last	492.0530
dartagnan did the same	48.6576
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	301.1251
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast	114.8765
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his <unk> quickly threw him on his back	404.3218
i see you require proofs	259.3726
i do not allude to you my boy	53.6176
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	212.5656
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years	409.0674
<unk> what is he doing there said the inspector	32.6306
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and <unk> while the <unk> of his forehead and the <unk> of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and <unk> shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but <unk> save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and <unk> more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole	437.5532
was struck with this <unk> and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery	921.6443
father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	109.8074
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance	777.3724
i charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest <unk> the letter bore the signature not of charles king but of <unk> king and let him be no longer king cried the queen	129.3855
and you did not tell him that you came from me no sir at ten oclock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter	44.3604
a bell resounded	949.3354
does he hate his majesty as much as he does us <unk> answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property true said aramis but silence	250.8575
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my <unk> a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned youis that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank <unk> it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	232.5335
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demi god has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man	12.9459
pale and trembling milady repulsed dartagnans attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed	577.5972
ah	83.3708
whom would they hang yourself or me	707.5094
would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him	197.8413
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial	129.9561
each was accompanied by two priests	37.3732
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone	93.2277
sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as i can myself	244.4801
milady uttered a stifled groan	30.4704
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but albert a first rate <unk> sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo	525.7029
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags	262.2632
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant	214.8673
it was towards this kiosk that we were <unk>	1614.4572
ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely	54.2178
so that in spite of edicts <unk> and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of csars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal <unk> who <unk> nothing as it is said	287.9193
believe me it is only the evil minded who deny friendship they cannot understand it	446.7754
chapter xxiii	224.8593
marie michon and what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	123.6536
what are you looking at asked dartagnan	24.9368
when she <unk> she can sup and he made some steps toward the door	362.5662
most probably morrel and chteau renaud returned to their domestic <unk> as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces but it was not the case with debray	237.7923
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	265.1564
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	182.6844
a large round rock placed <unk> on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead	445.7130
she is all powerful yonder she will help me	129.2872
the king had not yet returned from hunting	156.7991
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall	108.6899
you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here	59.2831
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer	96.7012
should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it	119.1933
shivering for want of a <unk>	659.1361
beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was <unk> everybody through his <unk>	991.3511
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a <unk> perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles	244.3644
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared	414.2874
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandr was irrevocably lost	151.1750
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a bas relief	2320.3384
monsieur porthos	22.9753
but wait a minute anne of austria ran to her jewel case	281.4177
london	84.0509
since you demand my resignation i retire then said aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	551.3976
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission	86.7994
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you <unk> too well	219.2838
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris ah <unk> paris	308.2354
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial and have you succeeded i think so madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room monte cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to consciousness	72.9324
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound	410.7591
my mind was already made up	101.9175
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and <unk> that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood	499.3457
let us see the dungeons let us first send for two soldiers said the governor	92.9209
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat	92.3988
have they allowed the headsman to escape suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square	1586.6846
they were at that part of the quai des <unk> where the steps lead down to the river	351.3166
i should think so but not without difficulty	73.8966
in their stead dartagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall	538.7642
i pray for it said dartagnan	51.6688
so call me mercds if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dants he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m dants said danglars bowing to the young couple	201.3568
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling yes	293.2218
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation	160.9730
the palikares who were <unk> at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke	218.6197
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you	27.6916
and here is mr mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging glances	239.7713
chapter xl	113.9024
close to the hedge the steps stopped	100.5185
there was no time to lose	9.4331
he had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay	103.7615
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale	103.5338
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a <unk> of <unk> a little face <unk> very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	1283.8273
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused	199.1267
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself	158.6148

colonel fairfax repeated bradshaw	945.1596
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette	272.9938

then replied mme	619.4492
the two latter followed their <unk> in the humble guise of captives without arms	470.7471
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his masters features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word	200.4681

this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m dpinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in 1815 that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the <unk> have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile	75.1977
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word	77.0208

i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dants who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom	153.3826
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dants agitation	600.8019

beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young mans paroxysm of grief approached him	315.7230
for one second dartagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and dartagnan recognized the coadjutor	67.8450
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the <unk> of <unk> served all possible <unk> requirements	158.6893
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered	96.3471
do you intend to struggle against our ill fortune	86.3781

then dartagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers	375.4287
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a <unk>	84.3406
oh the wretched hours i have <unk> torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it yes valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror	678.2419

they heard the horsemen pass under the windows	287.6336
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of <unk> it is for that reason you see me so early because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me no because i passed the night writing <unk> and twenty despatches	278.3140

the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell	273.7647

i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you	199.2181
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	960.3096

how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear <unk> friend lost to him forever and on his death bed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were maximilian it was edmond dants at these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and <unk> said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment	626.8437

the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the <unk> alone reflected its dull light on the window	115.0770

if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur yes seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de trville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn without doubt and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes you have already given me that reason and i find it excellent reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you about rent very kind and adding to this if there be need of it meaning to offer you fifty pistoles if against all probability you should be short at the present moment admirable	138.6643

at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated	104.5226
as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal	111.1532

well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are <unk> gone	194.1010

let us say no more about it say no more about it	21.5497
dartagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of la <unk> and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to st cloud	441.9998

on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away	292.8724
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account	133.6180

the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise dartagnan had made and opening the door said come in all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that dartagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard	188.8446
speak out theres a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor <unk> in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	634.9075

albert who was a great <unk> and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the caf de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros	226.5667
now the queen is of a sensitive nature	303.1942

but why has he waited till now	189.3574
as to hayde these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	313.3380
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a <unk> resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the <unk> of dartagnan who however placed himself between him and them	743.4953

but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	286.1719

pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion <unk> you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject	594.1494
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugnie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty	1878.4779
one night more and he would be on his way	35.5985
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man	60.0722
the <unk> you make <unk> for the <unk> of a queen and a princess	1547.6249
nothing more than natural	176.7836

my god my god my god she knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating arms	166.6149
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round	252.4027
whats to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you cannot take me with you no the order is imperative	379.0465
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous <unk> of the guides	505.9318
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment	1257.7554
for the poison which she <unk> there is no antidote yes yes	791.3074

allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain <unk> which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those <unk> were to whom they had been made and who had made them	107.1730
go young men	1056.7804
dartagnan <unk> on a plan	481.2450
he shall go thither and at his return you will send him to me	58.9543
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man possibly thought dartagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarins compliment	36.9526

at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	117.9625
raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out the spaniards	234.1395

its purple visage and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet	791.1512
i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics	260.8785
a war of partisans unworthy of a king the example of robert <unk> will absolve you sire no no	2431.4446
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer	157.3758

dants seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible	242.3921
did you know that no monseigneur	33.0771
in fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened but buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down	174.9055

well my dear father in the <unk> of <unk> life is an eternal <unk> of our <unk> cast into the sea my useless <unk> that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	1704.3798
a change indeed said albert	550.6372
then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz	225.3631
dants instantly turned to meet him	77.2509
ask porthos	1767.5713
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercds and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to <unk> assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dants was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his <unk>	71.7318
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew him	38.4161
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes mercds let them fall and sighed	43.8415
you have a park and horses servants athos smiled	924.3375
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth	222.6262
you must have had enough for today	107.6101

i know the french as well as if i had made them myself	48.7442
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a <unk> expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	337.9941
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery	1040.6262
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering	185.6887
diavolo	97.4812
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife	413.8561
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a state councillor then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly	49.7896
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch	144.1847
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity <unk> is a terrible word why so	2236.8469
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out	320.3800
two aces the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment	315.3185
how my fault yes i offered you escape by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door certainly porthos men like us cant go out from here purely and simply faith said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much dartagnan shrugged his shoulders	649.5140
i spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks and the prince was pleased with you he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken	103.1578
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told raoul bowed	87.4474
was it not i	41.4774
andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a <unk> stride soon traversed the space of two leagues	161.5348
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	755.7004
but <unk> i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross leap coward cried raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir said he courage	1081.7854
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving dartagnans composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you cannot pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration	140.0897
he remained listening and gazing	697.2061
madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing	149.9322
night came and at ten oclock they anchored	381.3194
you shall relate them to me my child	125.7972
albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well	153.4668
let us drink then she is dead stammered dartagnan	54.6293
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle	171.7198
morcerf and chteau renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission	211.5422
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed	2010.0916
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity and will you make the same promise to my love cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	59.4256
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground	106.2548
gentlemen he said the wood that i am <unk> is his i cut it in his <unk> and i am taking it to the chateau dartagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet	317.3344
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words	253.6188
dont be afraid said he smiling	21.9926
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine but the accomplice shall become the avenger	413.4902
to remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to <unk> him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own <unk> was her plan	246.0444
some straw they said	1376.6542
dont make a bad use of it i entreat you	58.7295
i understand said monte cristo well acquainted with alis pantomime you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative	1292.9614
it appeared however to milady that in one of the <unk> glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	168.9882
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart	227.7310
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to dartagnan	61.2560
do you <unk> a single creature	2471.0217
the youths dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day	1576.8357
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	394.8602
now i am going to show you how sincere i am good thought dartagnan we must look about us hes going to play us a trick i offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it	147.4107
oh beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine	1471.6604
i fancy i hear horses feet impossible returned dartagnan	286.9164
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres	272.2946

chapter lxv	100.0835
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource	194.6255
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and <unk> as myself	568.7503
oh yes she cried i do love you	96.5127
when shall we land in england he asked but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply	89.3097
a loan nothing more	731.8361
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away	178.6295
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour	43.5716
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect	245.3817
let me propose it then said dartagnan	46.7330
this account confirmed that of the mayor	529.2157
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near	44.5623
the mob dispersed	678.6906

gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i cannot leave	32.1089
i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twenty two years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh	105.9796
your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be <unk> of it and so my dear count said dartagnan his eminence didnt actually insist on our attending him it is du vallon and i who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat <unk> perhaps so great was our longing to see you at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture <unk> voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise	158.0944
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	11.6122
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked dartagnan	67.3589
come in said franz	123.4689
we are invited replied dartagnan to pass the night with m groslow	145.6264
a <unk> murmured my <unk> he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols	105.9717
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said dartagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to <unk> the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you dartagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter <unk> she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis	101.1420
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend dartagnan formed a part	484.3845
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of <unk> lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite	958.3512
now i have these proofs albert and i am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me	188.5160
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from <unk> to the <unk> and from tunis to venice	1143.5967
at this moment comminges rushed into the room	22.5566

the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special <unk> was made and fernand was compelled to join	1384.2787
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table	340.8420
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that <unk> innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance	1287.6830
planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at armentires	70.0813
thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say	179.0603
it is a charming place well supplied with spring water and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after	1274.2683
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love	560.8064
we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament	134.5345
gaetano was not mistaken	47.9274
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the <unk> with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return	158.6615
have you seen the cardinal he sent for me answered the mercer proudly	68.2624
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	44.3221
noirtier closed his eyes	8.0619

i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	164.8197
why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlinis teeth clenched convulsively	236.3421
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse dartagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain	80.2782
i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments i am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good french for i resided three years in paris then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man nearly	96.7335
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to davrigny and said and now the priest is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked davrigny	289.3893
m de villefort followed them	23.5676
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieux colombier	183.6808
why <unk> give you their <unk> press yours in <unk> keep up a whispering <unk> you to accompany them home	232.1820
what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell	237.6570
well said dartagnan one is never killed in a first engagement nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killedwell he will die bravely but <unk> such a misfortune <unk> athos passed his hand across his pale brow	158.6569
chapter ii	214.7967
you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion	913.4109
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as <unk> to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell <unk> bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great <unk> general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our <unk> is precious	424.3500
what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated no returned the count	326.2321
here they are monseigneur there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it	49.0170
adieu perhaps farewell at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw	217.3101
what shall we do said athos	16.5751
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks	46.1579
m	10.5631
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf	429.9272

undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery not to me i hope no not to you so i am going to tell you where he is porthos devoured dartagnan with wondering eyes	58.7400
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a <unk> all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the <unk> which we read of in fairy tales	296.4574
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me	10.2485
he passed on to <unk> also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full	439.5150
no nothing at all	187.1172
she scarcely resisted	510.3622
but felton did not give him time to draw it	41.8344
being no <unk> of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more <unk> than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob	216.4433
her skin was admired for its velvety <unk> her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable	985.8034

but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her dartagnan which is not the part of a gentleman we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop bah said dartagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it	84.6009
we will wait for these gentlemen so please you i have plenty of time and it will be more correct	71.4238
i thought i had crushed you madame but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan	181.1029
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments	340.9855
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one	87.0007
chapter 33 roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell	533.3776
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it	122.4496
have i not been there once yes but at that period we were not at war	75.6540

felton cried she	56.6956
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abb faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dants	181.3097
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four	686.4623
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	1043.6834

in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	62.3704
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew	146.3269
indeed	64.2855
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed perhaps it was some one in that occupation said cromwell	303.0293
this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the <unk>	434.7137
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily the friends embraced	489.2023
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation	421.6538
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment	79.9317
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	225.8027
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed	44.2136

i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	99.4847
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated i can sir said hayde drawing from under her veil a satin <unk> highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mothers <unk> latter has been sealed by the grand <unk> of <unk> and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the <unk> merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs a greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible <unk> which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence	174.7305

you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	113.7261
the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders	1847.6932
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg	153.9332
dartagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces	32.7940
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously	126.7718
i admire i love <unk> i know his former <unk> i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow and why day after to morrow asked madame de chevreuse	336.6753
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a <unk> of the army	58.1169
athos smiled	60.3495
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint martin and <unk> who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren	95.8395

in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech	128.3044
when you arrived madame de saint mran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed	194.1512
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate dartagnan drew up his request and m de trville on receiving it assured him that by two oclock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective <unk> of the travelers	97.3510

the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	27.5403
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold <unk> the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess	331.0816
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely	604.3286
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other <unk>	113.5225
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well	96.3640
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint mran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300000 livres	270.4442

grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	110.0812

m de trville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king	65.1147
what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence and shall we go and find him inquired franz	57.2321

he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master	491.8192

then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the ministers cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his <unk> ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber	34.8091

as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the <unk> and jealousy of some unknown enemy	529.7449
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms	194.7337
where has he gone i do not know what do you mean	13.2610

in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him	510.9805

the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight	300.9541
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the <unk> that play about the marshes	1433.2805
he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier	130.1707

the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs	1805.0076

in the most simple and natural manner possible	59.0684
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	80.7178
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical	536.8741
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself ah ah said porthos that is what you meant to say yes dear monsieur porthos	436.4446

the count followed her with his eyes	30.5788

dartagnan who had <unk> <unk> to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it	350.5246

one instant after the heavy step of a <unk> who served as sentinel was heard in the <unk> <unk> in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder	723.1046
excuse my not coming to meet you but added he looking at dartagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me no has the host told you nothing then i asked after you and came up as soon as i could porthos seemed to breathe more freely	59.6931
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	188.0178
chapter lx	92.0271
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams	889.6700
he turned up his <unk> neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner	411.3373

had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of you are right aramis let us travel on to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	156.6870

and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass dartagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been <unk> at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m de la trmouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his htel	90.4740

nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her	139.5426
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	20.1182

while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via <unk> which led directly between the <unk> and rospoli palaces franzs attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant	243.1947

the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that csar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals	224.5730
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of dartagnan and porthos	53.7397

here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are	212.5104
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent <unk> are only feints to deceive fools	1067.3409
on reaching the door he bowed	30.9389
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	315.9209
yes	71.1517
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts <unk> also	609.3304

my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to <unk> in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	86.6456
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the <unk> repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dants succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	109.7591
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious <unk> on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning	1039.8702

before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a <unk> a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him	210.8117
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in italy and so highly honored	1295.5485
then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders and on one of those lovely shoulders round and white dartagnan recognized with inexpressible astonishment the fleur de <unk> indelible mark which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted	264.0126
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me	35.3694
oh	32.3012
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top	1278.1367
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said dartagnan it is the queens diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos	257.1126
planchet said dartagnan i am going out for all day perhaps	54.8971
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked	56.6831
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a childs caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mothers voice when she <unk> me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given	1981.9592
i inherit my fathers name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should <unk> it	184.3196

life itself may be resolved into three words <unk> est <unk> which means said dartagnan who began to suspect the truth	1149.0825
his gravity made him look older than he was well then if we can get athos all will be well	255.6169
the count alone seemed <unk> more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks	1285.9526
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent	181.9436
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table	343.9007
it was done on purpose for mei am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty	154.8314
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty	1945.7501

she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs	116.8241
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god	712.1277
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint mran oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure	69.8315

himself <unk> very well show him to me at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt	582.3922
it resulted from these <unk> that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	1260.3845
no one at villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	694.2919

yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a <unk> without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way	677.1451
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	1825.8691
you are madames brother i <unk> it so but fortunately you are not mine it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual <unk> in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go <unk> the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at dartagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her	289.4599

a man who <unk> himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours	334.9824
ah that is really original said beauchamp	221.9739
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos	207.2562
at that moment planchet put his head <unk> in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready	122.6971
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the <unk> strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of <unk> only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and <unk> its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination	975.0667

nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years	64.6755
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration	242.2945
the approach was not such as to <unk> <unk> ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand <unk>	446.2235
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us	200.3323
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	331.3437
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	323.1850
nothing nothing only shut the window	485.4196
villefort caught his arm	263.7142
this <unk> us downstairs bernouin the valet held a wax light the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal	474.0675
at the end of the second day m de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the abb busoni a sicilian priest of high <unk> in the east where he has done much good m de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abb who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two <unk> house behind saint sulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant	40.8265
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible	76.2442
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	106.3165
there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune and stationed himself between <unk> and la <unk>	915.1287
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom	121.4579
mercds raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her	32.4838
i could almost believe myself at the caf de paris murmured danglars	131.9998
it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina	118.8303
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at all	82.8510
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex	1137.6090
who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after gods own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who <unk> himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the <unk> of this argument	994.3602
then they did not watch over this man	55.2921
be satisfied beautiful constance	852.8555
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted	44.6126
thanks monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you	95.5218
at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count you asked milady	122.7418
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy	114.6101
coward	13.0714
to prison with him	342.8899
isnt it reasonable yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than <unk> was noble and generous	144.4109
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dants do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the <unk> and the learned	198.0530
you morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs	256.2433
i dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	2255.7561
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there	690.8129
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	47.2096
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative	613.8240
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone	674.9525
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again	698.6597
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so no replied the count i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in me i your excellency yes you	775.1124
dartagnan went last still shaking his head	414.1260
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his <unk> as your excellency knows there are no thieves in <unk> that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement	85.5724
it will be useless for him to find you here she rang the bell and kitty appeared	67.7712
why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me	239.8262
fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs at ten oclock then if you please i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow very well at ten oclock you are still at the htel des princes yes the following morning with the bankers usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young mans hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse	265.5000
has not some sage said nothing too much	1276.9611
make way for us planchet said dartagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass they are friends the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again	194.2485
we were to have conveyed her to a htel in the place royale said the wounded man	52.2602
guard the prisoners well i beg of you the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and dartagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	49.3693
what do you mean to say	4.8142
monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound <unk> plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce	2393.4631
i have brought him up	46.1995
it was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king	44.8559
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes	125.1988
the moment is at hand he said	91.1943
what <unk> they may try a month hence to marry me again and to <unk>	1483.8174
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	136.3207
theres a fellow who will never desert me so long as you are rich	54.4951
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest <unk> of which it is capable	85.9498
i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about	1029.7961
pay and eat and what am i to pay with brute said danglars enraged	520.6891
do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux truly without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty why he is a very devil this barnais	292.3496
have i sir comprehended your instructions athos smiled	1814.4897
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	463.6048
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	234.9855
the famous secretaire is in the dressing room is there a window in the dressing room <unk> here and one there andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom	275.1510
what replied the englishman	67.6565
an hour passed during which dants excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves	200.9074
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation	22.9395
speak my child speak said dartagnan i listen here	105.5655
well asked athos when he had closed the letter	25.6057
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs <unk> and nosegays	933.1560
mercds and albert were in that room	118.1277
the tutor followed them	568.4428
you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier dherblay that i am altogether and always at your service athos and aramis bowed and went out	97.1151
ah	60.2024
so much the better	2.6861
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	62.2946
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison	298.7747
there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice <unk> voce	690.4359
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she <unk> herself smelled at her <unk> and walked up and down	1186.8291
valentine with her womans instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristos second and from the young mans well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	188.6175
ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare	239.9203
they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur darminges	135.2591
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly <unk> to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself	1881.1724
my <unk> told you that nobody but i know it i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon <unk> firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria	216.7424
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me	142.8479
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea	143.0609
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips	22.9454
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her	71.6108
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet thats it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had even to his horse monsieur for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was <unk> monsieur porthoss horse as well as his masters	168.4559
athos smiled	60.3495
at last one day when for the hundredth time i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child	150.0770
oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the <unk> coronet you promised me dartagnan bah	597.1900
when they entered the port it was already night	66.3261
we shall require it yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for <unk> badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	343.3731
yet he did not return home	17.4248
he wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the htel	287.7903
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwells tent dartagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle	147.1136
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door	75.5319
let me think a moment	102.1524
but the <unk> of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow	115.4648
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently	162.8290
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress but then you would be close to the sea that is what i hoped and supposing you had succeeded i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near <unk> isle de <unk> or the isle de <unk> then i should have been safe could you have swum so far heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost all yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me tell me at least who you are i <unk> am no	223.3093
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time	196.9042
this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her <unk> from her high estate indeed well my lord four men resolved to save her	936.4163
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between <unk> chapelle and la <unk> and after a <unk> along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	23.9588
the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly still said the queen	185.3229
stop a <unk> this is it <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> which means beware of the enemy who makes you presents this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied dartagnan it comes from the queen from the queen	1195.4413
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock struck	399.7831
the <unk> never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times <unk> like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer	535.9882
<unk> monte cristo poured a little <unk> water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of <unk> hayde dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the <unk> was a friend	245.1457
what a flavor cried dartagnan ah	705.3889
if it is a snare replied dartagnan i shall scent it out be assured	215.2029
take your handkerchief whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of it monsieur is a gascon asked aramis	89.5620
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar	240.9924
he folded the letter <unk> and took up his pen and wrote to <unk>	736.2482
<unk> you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place	128.5495
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young mans frame	210.4897
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage	861.5214
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m	207.8427
are you not the captain fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali	645.2217
the glass cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him	252.8068
the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m morrel was announced	105.6513
he is moving and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see	46.7546
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious <unk> what way was the escape to be effected	842.5822
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face	126.2503
as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted	123.6956
have you answered the question i put to you on entering the <unk> do you keep the poison you generally use madame madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other	157.6969
ay said he i see but you shall not kill me today	39.7664
oliva corsinari was it not oliva corsinari a marchioness a marchioness and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family yes that was the way it ended and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said monte cristo	411.4511
i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles	49.7960
i pardon you for my <unk> future my lost honor my <unk> love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me	1024.8786
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me	104.7692
why edmond dants and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed <unk> as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	766.9622
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption	474.2351
ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house	348.6127
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic <unk> cabbages walk gravely about <unk> heads bellow from mens shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in <unk> temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of <unk>	1036.5234
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of <unk> in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy <unk> and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there <unk> ready	1254.6497
at the same minute one of the little windows of the htel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared	35.9476
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets	373.3123
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the <unk> who against all <unk> custom found themselves in the presence of five men	398.4307
he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke	73.9607
the day passed away in utter <unk> came without recurrence of the noise	921.0233
porthos bowed as if in assent	186.8555
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want <unk> on famine agitated by fear torn by faction	169.0860
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos	106.6970
what means this asked the count	71.1722
on the left was an old abandoned <unk> with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an <unk> threw out its shrill <unk> and monotonous cry	1344.4248
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone	641.5391
well said porthos i will run to the htel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight oclock the rendezvous the place du palais cardinal	109.5040
not an instant to be lost	29.4772
help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue	501.8617
sdeath	76.5017
are you a man of <unk> poet	414.6848
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter	1725.7505
it is well said he kissing it it is my masters ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it	96.7746
ah then madame i was able for one instant to be alone with you	60.7126
de chevreuse and mme	48.7278
stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising you still owe me something i said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me a louis on account a louis on account for a fowl certainly and your excellency now owes me <unk> louis danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke	327.3972
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his <unk> as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	238.1013
faith	50.4851
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just <unk> will have blood	968.7393
but apropos you belong to the fronde do you not madame i serve the king yes in your own way my way is the way of all gentlemen and i know only one way answered athos haughtily	85.9178
14 be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing	75.1147
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a <unk> from his pocket began to <unk> a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out	285.6624
the only thing that <unk> me is that he did not strike me dead at once	125.1233
dartagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying thats a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice	481.9205
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news	48.8566
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could	412.5140
come gentlemen come the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him	146.1473
he might have been taken for a statue	37.8541
i beg you will remove your bandage it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a <unk> costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk <unk> a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked <unk> was passed through his girdle	116.1358
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an <unk> suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge <unk> the young woman hid her face in her hands	601.5630
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous <unk> of an enthusiastic and delighted audience	875.6214
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said dartagnan that matters little	140.6858
do you hear said the king	13.6346
and what brought you here i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort	214.7793
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before hayde	309.2242
this hole communicated with a kind of <unk> space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below it	138.4279
diable said morcerf	99.4245
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door	62.2267
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place	101.4571
you lose ground you are turning	1609.6835
he turned towards his wife	33.5320
now said aramis we know how the matter stands	146.0424
what comments must be made and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph it is frightful murmured mazarin	1205.5306
it is only five minutes past eight said he to morrel there is not much time lost yet oh i made no allusion of that kind replied morrel	68.3043
i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under ones hand such as mines lands and <unk> property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions i call those second rate fortunes that are gained by <unk> enterprises joint stock companies <unk> and principalities not drawing more than 1500000 francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions finally i call those third rate fortunes which are composed of a <unk> capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false <unk> <unk> such as banks speculations of the <unk> fact all operations under the influence of greater or less <unk> the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions	1074.0324
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you	122.4729
go the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him	301.5802
aramis if that is all it is easily done said porthos	56.3970
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	315.3041
i have seen his servant said one and that <unk> very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that <unk> very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	179.5876
you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me	329.0610
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features	53.3398
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house the other the physician	102.6542
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude	295.0468
go make out my bill and <unk> my servant what monsieur will you leave us so soon you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse	228.0927
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	117.7489
they seemed awaiting orders	1109.4598
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian pardon me you are right	59.3749
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the <unk> and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah	165.0345
he is of no earthly use to anybody and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice	208.0984
adieu madame in saying these words dartagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved	216.6266
to the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal to the soubrette she had given the heart of a duchess	328.8952
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton	28.1419
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly	302.7399
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position	1550.3518
bazin remained at the window	18.3889
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that <unk> politeness that most <unk> barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man	331.7143
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful	185.4099
he <unk> was silent as it had been for the last three days	76.1522
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the trademark license is very easy	13.8161

the htel de la trmouille at these cries all who were in the htel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence	105.0291

yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dants knew that he had escaped the first peril	207.6420
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer	200.2652

his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their <unk> orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion they resolved to profit by the counts courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous <unk> they had sustained	80.9111
just then the lamp again <unk> the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain	387.2410
dartagnan took his hand	13.7638

the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness	134.0943
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief	104.5993
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	424.5054

pray was danglars acquainted with fernand <unk> he was	1967.1405
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction	411.0622
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him	55.5270
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too	120.3116

villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity	344.6692

dartagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it	69.3411
well answered the boy the thing is done where is he gone the half pistole is for me doubtless answer me i want to see it	126.7225
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them	272.5845
his whiskers cut off noirtier gave another turn to his hair took instead of his black cravat a colored <unk> which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and high buttoned frock coat a coat of villeforts of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his sons which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small <unk> switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy <unk> which was one of his principal characteristics	728.9855
now that i have the word of athos i can set out dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	82.0291

as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated <unk> that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him	218.1602
we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child	229.2546
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of <unk> and vexation on his bed	194.1548

the road was long but the horses upon which dartagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for dartagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant	323.5807
as soon as there was room for <unk> his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	251.5931

at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his <unk> beneath the waves	767.6489
the cardinal seemed furious	737.7146
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper	289.2770

he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed	919.0666

athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	107.5083
he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii	1095.0103
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed	187.1158
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	119.5301
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams	904.7836
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	54.3825
what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be	68.9549
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him	445.1244
you confess it exclaimed mazarin	445.7072
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events	199.3843

at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	173.0405
porthos opened his mouth to reply dartagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	189.6385
all paris were in the streets	45.5726
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there and therein consisted the infamy replied milady	351.5879
but you my <unk> you not going to change your dress no i shall go as i am	205.9162

let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds dartagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family	189.9229
if you went to spain would you not see the bull fights	1310.1914
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his <unk> falling over his shoes sleeves <unk> up and mustaches stiff with agitation	143.4977
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining <unk> did i not tell you just now that i was rich <unk> rich	189.4976
but though i cannot give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my fathers	180.7912

do not my mother and you agree asked albert astonished	116.5956
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	46.1826
well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting	48.2756
at the same hour as on the preceding evening dartagnan retired	48.4798
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of bthune with milady her mortal enemy	350.1915
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the <unk> in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science	135.3874
at the hotel de ville	7.3892
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>	815.4500
it was in the name of comte de wardes	16.7835
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother	61.8976
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water	67.6401

these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting <unk> into his pocket	705.8875
what he asked athos	45.3078
but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to <unk> malicious half ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of <unk> emotion in his paralyzed frame	107.7941
is it mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent oh you hear that flamarens said chatillon	1260.4746

draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands	511.3369
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints	123.7125
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	934.4991
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it	271.1757
oh my god	6.6139
edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of <unk> in his head and severe pains in his <unk>	402.9854
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door	269.9174
the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and csar borgia paying him most marked attentions	161.1259
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abb busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo	107.6220

i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves	68.4976
why so i play with monsieur du vallon every night	114.4667
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	310.2792
porthos and aramis did the same	15.0167
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend said porthos	16.7353
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	23.8070
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine <unk> with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of <unk> and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank <unk> you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist	147.5373
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name	283.2149
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman	105.7919
gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	378.4483

why it was he who carried me off that may be madame and you receive silver from that man have you not said that that abduction was entirely political yes but that abduction had for its object the <unk> of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say i say you are a miserable creature continued mme	143.5799

chapter 63 the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room	330.2735

he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them	22.0460
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men	268.3891
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	787.4174
what do you want with me said she	7.2058
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead	85.0061

the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris	200.7488
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart	767.9539
ah pardieu is that you said porthos to dartagnan	56.8214

dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	324.1575
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	151.2356
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the <unk> wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m bonacieux	183.6124
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting	625.7232
we have our clothes some more splendid than <unk> is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the <unk> on a railway the size of which is <unk> by the smoke and steam surrounding it	777.6835
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence	143.9058
now you have done grimaud take our brigadiers half pike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king grimaud obeyed without replying	523.3533
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere	96.2309
patience athos	176.8789
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized dants who followed passively	733.9058
the nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count	547.6787
it was about nine oclock in the morning	7.3728
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the <unk> tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat	127.8253
dartagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	374.0899
grimaud speaks	209.9012
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers	455.5475
the tree was easy to climb	1055.4041
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond	317.2006
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic why so said danglars why dramatic can we account for instinct said monte cristo	426.7623
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own	154.6229
well she said at length do you not answer me i have but one question to ask youwhat do you intend to do i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart	81.7680
dants ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	367.0460
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	898.4191
the walls were hollowed out in <unk> one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead	346.6350
you have seen the count you say i have only just left him and has he <unk> to all that the letter specified he has do you understand it not in the least there is a dupe somewhere at all events it is neither you nor i certainly not well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does no i agree with you there	73.7981
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their <unk>	117.3324
oh for pitys sake you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him listen to me my son has also guessed who you <unk> attributes his fathers misfortunes to you madame you are mistaken they are not <unk> is a punishment	103.7935
yes what to do noirtier made no answer	143.2399
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition	80.4533
he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of <unk> the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m morrel and strong in the <unk> table which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him	1100.3490
and who is the cause of all this annoyance my father as i told you m	29.9580
coquenard	32.4359
ah he is not a man like that cursed dartagnan	107.4468
the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed	79.6936
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd	491.0121
see look at fernand and follow his example he is well behaved <unk> fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the <unk> was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercds smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	446.3208
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us but this fire continued franz	54.4374
<unk> if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	59.7909
the house may be suspected but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur dartagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal was it not this dartagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes dchausss asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation	96.5591
now the <unk> says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord that is true said his <unk>	1726.4304
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemans word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so thats porthos all over murmured dartagnan	158.1308
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and <unk> then sight returned and with it feeling and grief	354.6865
shall i go and offer her my services thought he	136.3208
nothing but bitter recollections and he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks	49.8510
he reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less witty	712.3189
he will set sail tomorrow morning fort la pointe or fort <unk> was not built until <unk> nearly 50 years later	646.2483
<unk> such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m de boville the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome presented himself at m morrels	52.2195
anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity	117.1940
mordaunt went away with the captain	77.6284
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal <unk> and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz	304.5416
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	139.3916
as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap	63.3247
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready your pardon said richelieu surprised	806.5602
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the <unk> mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	392.2959
you will kill yourself cried planchet	92.7665
dartagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him	62.1549
if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price faith	390.3458
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold <unk> policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on alberts side	219.5628
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information to auteuil cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became <unk> go to auteuil well what is there surprising in that	171.9521

in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where dartagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be	128.9016
in one case or the other the trial was soon over	144.5747
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a <unk> in the night	178.5309
this was neither long nor difficult	365.1775
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it	605.3738
let me conduct your business and my own	124.8086

as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar	236.0106
ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise darmilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine	85.4360

friquet had put on his sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry <unk> into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from bazin	248.9575
dartagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	558.4017

then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth	753.5903
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of dartagnan and of athos it must be the best but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison egad cried dartagnan hes just the man i count upon	40.4605

this noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command	464.3240
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes	695.3749

in fact dartagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests	70.4959
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort	414.5952
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared	59.4578

what troubles me is the idea of defeat	927.6425

i did not observe it yesterday it must be the fog rising from the river said the king	86.1102
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	535.3113
the governor of the bastile was monsieur du tremblay the brother of the famous capuchin joseph that fearful favorite of <unk> who went by the name of the gray cardinal	1072.5621
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of <unk> <unk> with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercds seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly	152.2215
besides to tell truth whilst dartagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to <unk> with athos true hearted open athos	669.5013
you here rochefort he said in a low voice	36.4704
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now	285.4035
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace	1116.2139
danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf	35.1019
come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of <unk> bed	47.7178

debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband	107.8778
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtiers expression than by valentines indisposition	374.5555
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by dartagnan and porthos	108.2701
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a <unk>	499.0685
orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded	994.3670
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful <unk>	68.0716

a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said dartagnan	682.9216
these <unk> naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	2251.2837
yes indeed cried dartagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him yes surely he said he said resumed porthos	82.3815

mazarin bowed	402.1941

bonacieux blushed	476.9644
ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely	19.0010
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurators wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory	157.9399
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	250.0687
this enemy was milady	357.8927
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to delbeuf	427.8959

the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue	37.9320
yes said chteau renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed you are fastidious chteau renaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and quite new that is just what i find fault with	629.9858
grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news	739.1139
that m danglars speculates whereas he never does truly madame i recollect m debray told <unk> what has become of him	2352.5747
he thought that voice more feeble than usual	662.6373
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized yes yes	200.9481

well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch but will it not be lost oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up a gardener grimaud nodded	160.1437
you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak <unk> or arrests me	1137.0527
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was <unk> to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m dpinay dear valentine that will account to you for the <unk> manner which you observed between me and eugnie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed ah how good you are to say so valentine	770.5189
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively	78.5350
nevertheless to dartagnans great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely	246.6743
or a tiger ali bowed his head in token of assent	102.5855
ready said he with his usual <unk>	161.6279
look fernand your eyes are better than mine	233.5932
so no more delay no more hesitation or else whatever may be my repugnance to <unk> my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words dartagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up	1072.2865
